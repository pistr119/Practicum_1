who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette
suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess
and having asked for a needle began tracing the Condé coat of arms on the table
in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else
with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family
has declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose their own form of government; and I believe that once free from the usurper
Monsieur le Vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far
after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on earth
because the Bourbons fled from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy
as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were
Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess
But when she saw that Pierre’s sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte
and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him
that Napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of Arcola
who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of Pierre’s remarks
rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go
Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend
’   Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his audience
Here he could contain himself no longer and went on
still Anna Pávlovna and the others appreciated Prince Hippolyte’s social tact in so agreeably ending Pierre’s unpleasant and unamiable outburst
how to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one; that is
turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak
They listened to the French sentences which to them were meaningless
with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so
If it were a war for freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the army; but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is not right
Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre’s childish words
He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense
I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit me
She had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other
I don’t understand it; I don’t in the least understand why men can’t live without wars
said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly ill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member
and above all conviction that she would herself regret her words
squirrel-like expression of the princess’ pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear
and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married
Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and
with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on his face
That’s my advice: never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of
and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is
or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake
If you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future
As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolkónski who had lolled in Anna Pávlovna’s easy chairs and with half-closed eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth
It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times
said he (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte)
trivial in everything—that’s what women are when you see them in their true colors
He considered his friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked
and which might be best described as strength of will
And if Pierre was often struck by Andrew’s lack of capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he himself was particularly addicted)
Pierre was staying at Prince Vasíli Kurágin’s and sharing the dissipated life of his son Anatole
Pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home
But the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night
It was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night
he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go
The thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was of no account
all such ‘words of honor’ are conventional things with no definite meaning
especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead
Dólokhov was holding the Englishman’s hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet
The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved
The middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one
produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face
The window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen
who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the gentlemen around
I bet fifty imperials —he spoke French that the Englishman might understand him
that I will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth
and though he kept nodding to show that he understood
Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily
only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar
and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort
It seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed
Suddenly Dólokhov made a backward movement with his spine
banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window
no appointment to Kutúzov’s staff despite all Anna Mikháylovna’s endeavors and entreaties
with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling Bóry
who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as a cornet
had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time
carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually
sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but self-confident French; then again
Sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall
a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs
interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs
asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor alluded to
It seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked
Dólokhov has been degraded to the ranks and Bezúkhov’s son sent back to Moscow
They tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka Canal
Princess Anna Mikháylovna intervened in the conversation
I can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut
And as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman
but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now rose and took their leave
The visitor’s daughter was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother
hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock
darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room
It was evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far
was all Natásha managed to utter (to her everything seemed funny)
She leaned against her mother and burst into such a loud
and related quietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was still quite a young lady
before her nose was broken; how she had aged during the five years he had known her
She turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother
CHAPTER XII  The only young people remaining in the drawing room
half-grown kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat
She evidently considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by smiling
but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to join the army
with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone
flaring up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion
It is not from friendship at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation
and then with a distressed face left the room to find Sónya
how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them now
repeating the mistake of so many parents who imagine that their children have no secrets from them
CHAPTER XIII  When Natásha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the conservatory
when she heard the young man’s discreet steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly
brushed a little dust from the sleeve of his uniform
Suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he
the countess was so tired that she gave orders to admit no more
but the porter was told to be sure to invite to dinner all who came  to congratulate
She lingered in the room with the inkstand in her hand
because there can never be anything wrong in my behavior
went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf
Looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer
you know my love for my son: I would do anything for his happiness
My only hope now is in Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov
Although the hall porter saw someone’s carriage standing at the entrance
after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without asking to be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the rows of statues in niches) and looking significantly at the lady’s old cloak
who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing
The mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large Venetian mirror in the wall
were about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they entered
the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and Prince Vasíli came out—wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast
Prince Vasíli dismissed the doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of inquiry
as though unaware of the cold offensive look fixed on her
Prince Vasíli without acknowledging the bow turned to Anna Mikháylovna
here in Moscow to Anna Mikháylovna whom he had placed under an obligation
betraying neither annoyance at the prince’s brusque manner nor a desire to enter into conversation
as though she too knew that Count Rostóv deserved this censure
had not managed to choose a career for himself in Petersburg
and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to Moscow
The story told about him at Count Rostóv’s was true
Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear
He had now been for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father’s house
Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father—who were never favorably disposed toward him—would have used it to turn the count against him
two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud
It was the eldest who was reading—the one who had met Anna Mikháylovna
The two younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier
Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper
followed by the low but ringing laughter of the sister with the mole
Next day Prince Vasíli had arrived and settled in the count’s house
He sent for Pierre and said to him:  My dear fellow
if you are going to behave here as you did in Petersburg
Since then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in his rooms upstairs
When Borís appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room
But before Pierre—who at that moment imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just effected the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured London—could pronounce Pitt’s sentence
Borís felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to introduce himself
Borís knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read the papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuve’s name
Just now they are talking about you and your father
and being of the same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the Boulogne expedition
and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles into Borís’ eyes
After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and down the room for a long time
CHAPTER XVII  After Anna Mikháylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov
and having kissed his wife’s hand he went back to his study
was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess’ little table
The count took the gentlemen into his study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes
though he was dressed like a most fashionable young man
He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and
having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth
an officer in the Semënov regiment with whom Borís was to travel to join the army
laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian expressions with the choicest French phrases—which was a peculiarity of his speech
His conversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain calm and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing on himself
He could remain silent for hours without being at all put out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable
Were I in the cavalry I should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months
and vacancies occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards
Then just think what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles
avoid engaging in any long conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk
but he went on naïvely looking around through his spectacles as if in search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables
The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikháylovna
The latter understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man
who beamed with the pleasure of her saint’s-day fete
the countess followed on the arm of a colonel of hussars
with the hussar colonel on his left and Shinshín and the other male visitors on his right
threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair
At the ladies’ end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time
ate and drank so much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests
Berg with tender smiles was saying to Véra that love is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling
Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines
Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count’s monogram that stood before his plate
Pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment
to whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile
Sónya wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now she turned pale
now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas and Julie were saying to one another
The governess kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the children
trying to appear as if he did not want any of that wine
but was mortified because no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted it
but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge
CHAPTER XIX  At the men’s end of the table the talk grew more and more animated
he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter
turning his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger
Sónya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking
startled; but seeing by her daughter’s face that it was only mischief
confident that her prank would be taken in good part
not at Márya Dmítrievna’s answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to treat Márya Dmítrievna in this fashion
and in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces
After she had played a little air with variations on the harp
She looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to look for her
Natásha concluded that she must be on the chest in the passage
The chest in the passage was the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the Rostóv household
sitting on the blue-striped feather bed and hugging her friend
as if she had guessed the true reason of her friend’s sorrow
these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some others
but don’t you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice it all was
shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest
To feel that in this world there’s one      Who still is thinking but of thee
He had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get ready to dance in the large hall
and the sound of the feet and the coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery
in a political conversation in which several others joined but which bored Pierre
When the music began Natásha came in and walking straight up to Pierre said
And lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender little girl
She was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown-up lady
She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold
a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the écossaise was ended
and quite forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter
As soon as the provocatively gay strains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance) began to sound
her powerful arms hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess)
and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the dance
What was expressed by the whole of the count’s plump figure
charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on his light feet
Márya Dmítrievna produced no less impression by slight exertions—the least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning
who had been assiduous in sending aides-de-camp to inquire after the count’s health
Everyone stood up respectfully when the Military Governor
whenever anyone went into or came from the dying man’s room
I knew someone who received that sacrament seven times
Take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar
and he moved away with a decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to understand and state the patient’s condition
Meanwhile Prince Vasíli had opened the door into the princess’ room
In this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning before the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles
looked directly at Prince Vasíli with no sign of emotion in her prominent gray eyes
Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons with a sigh
giving his face an unpleasant expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room
holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony hands
clutching the little table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly:  what if a letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for Pierre’s legitimation
how is it you don’t see that if the count has written a letter to the Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate
I have just been talking to Dmítri Onúfrich  (the family solicitor)  and he says the same
She pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress
to ease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice
I shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward
We’ve got to it at last—why did you not tell me about it sooner
CHAPTER XXII  While these conversations were going on in the reception room and the princess’ room
a carriage containing Pierre (who had been sent for) and Anna Mikháylovna (who found it necessary to accompany him) was driving into the court of Count Bezúkhov’s house
having turned with words of comfort to her companion
Pierre followed Anna Mikháylovna out of the carriage
and only then began to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him
He noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back door
Pierre noticed several other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides
yet judging by Anna Mikháylovna’s air of assurance and haste
Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary
but the conviction that all this had to be grew stronger
addressing a maid who was hurrying past with a decanter on a tray as  my dear  and  my sweet
asked about the princess’ health and then led Pierre along a stone passage
The first door on the left led into the princesses’ apartments
The maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door (everything in the house was done in haste at that time)
and Pierre and Anna Mikháylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room
while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all her might
dimly lit room adjoining the count’s reception room
It was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front approach
They were met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them
They went into the reception room familiar to Pierre
with two Italian windows opening into the conservatory
with its large bust and full length portrait of Catherine the Great
Anna Mikháylovna’s face expressed a consciousness that the decisive moment had arrived
entered the room even more boldly than that afternoon
not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller
The doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his shoulders
and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and wait for her
casting significant looks at him with a kind of awe and even servility
At first Pierre wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady
and also to pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not even in his way; but all at once he felt that this would not do
and that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which everyone expected of him
placing his huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the naïve attitude of an Egyptian statue
and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be
and that in order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his own ideas tonight
but must yield himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him
Not two minutes had passed before Prince Vasíli with head erect majestically entered the room
He was wearing his long coat with three stars on his breast
and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of illness
Prince Vasíli said something to Lorrain in passing and went through the door on tiptoe
and the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door
as if there were now no further need for permission to enter that room
with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on the other an immense case containing icons
was brightly illuminated with red light like a Russian church during evening service
with that gray mane of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion
with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons
turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead
with an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was about
and remained with it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing Pierre she again began to laugh
She evidently felt unable to look at him without laughing
but could not resist looking at him: so to be out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns
understood the full importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it
He now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life
with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free
then the people resumed their places and the service continued
During this interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vasíli left the chair on which he had been leaning
and moved with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings
On leaving the bed both Prince Vasíli and the princess passed out by a back door
but returned to their places one after the other before the service was concluded
Pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on
and the voice of the priest was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the sacrament
The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before
Around him everyone began to stir: steps were audible and whispers
among which Anna Mikháylovna’s was the most distinct
he had not lost sight of for a single moment during the whole service
exclaimed different voices; and the heavy breathing of the bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried
But now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers
and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing
When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him
but with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man
carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt
Neither the hand nor a single muscle of the count’s face stirred
Once more Pierre looked questioningly at Anna Mikháylovna to see what he was to do next
Again Pierre fell into the naïvely symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue
who still gazed at the spot where Pierre’s face had been before he sat down
Anna Mikháylovna looked attentively at the sick man’s eyes
The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience
one of his arms fell back helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward
Whether he noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm
CHAPTER XXIV  There was now no one in the reception room except Prince Vasíli and the eldest princess
who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine the Great and talking eagerly
As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion they became silent
and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide something as she whispered:   I can’t bear the sight of that woman
merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze below the shoulder
Pierre went with Anna Mikháylovna into the small drawing room
There is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this delicious Russian tea
Lorrain was saying with an air of restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small circular room
Around the table all who were at Count Bezúkhov’s house that night had gathered to fortify themselves
had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who
as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders
looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times
Now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles
On one small table tea things and supper dishes stood in disorder
and betraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the bedroom
Pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have liked to
blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other from passing
won’t this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment when he needs repose
which were so flabby that they looked heavier below
addressing Prince Vasíli and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she held in her hand
suddenly shrieked the princess so loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled
Why do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere
darting unexpectedly at Anna Mikháylovna and snatching the portfolio from her
and when she returned he was fast asleep with his head on his arm
Anna Mikháylovna returned to the Rostóvs’ and went to bed
On waking in the morning she told the Rostóvs and all her acquaintances the details of Count Bezúkhov’s death
it was so touching that she could not think of it without tears
the arrival of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected
but this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old prince’s household
General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andréevich (nicknamed in society
and to develop these two cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry till she was twenty
and arranged her life so that her whole time was occupied
or superintending the building that was always going on at his estate
As regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity
regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of exactitude
He always came to table under precisely the same conditions
so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused
Although he was in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs
till the prince appeared punctually to the appointed hour
On the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive
Princess Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the morning greeting
and every morning prayed that the daily interview might pass off well
The prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round continued his work
showed that the prince still possessed the tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age
quickly finding the page and making a scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail
stooping over the book close to his daughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat
The princess looked in a scared way at her father’s eyes glittering close to her; the red patches on her face came and went
and could think only of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem in peace
The old man was beside himself: moved the chair on which he was sitting noisily backward and forward
having taken and closed the exercise book with the next day’s lesson
but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut book from the high desk
She put down the geometry book and eagerly broke the seal of her letter
Though I tell myself that half my life and half my happiness are wrapped up in you
and that in spite of the distance separating us our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds
deep and luminous (it seemed as if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm light)—were so beautiful that very often in spite of the plainness of her face they gave her an attraction more powerful than that of beauty
her face assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass
Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war
and it is Monsieur Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been recognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count Bezúkhov and possessor of the finest fortune in Russia
It is rumored that Prince Vasíli played a very despicable part in this affair and that he returned to Petersburg quite crestfallen
has become Count Bezúkhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia
As for the past two years people have amused themselves by finding husbands for me (most of whom I don’t even know)
the matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess Bezúkhova
But you will understand that I have no desire for the post
It is neither more nor less than with Prince Vasíli’s son Anatole
whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich and distinguée
and Mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Apráksins’
Read the mystical book I am sending you; it has an enormous success here
Though there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp
Let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife
The princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed
Then she suddenly rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table
if we had not religion to console us life would be very sad
and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself
The news of Count Bezúkhov’s death reached us before your letter and my father was much affected by it
for the volume you have sent me and which has such success in Moscow
Yet since you tell me that among some good things it contains others which our weak human understanding cannot grasp
it seems to me rather useless to spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit
I never could understand the fondness some people have for confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts and excite their imagination
know the terrible and holy secrets of Providence while we remain in this flesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal
who rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less we seek to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us
should the Almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as faithfully as I can
Not only where you are—at the heart of affairs and of the world—is the talk all of war
even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature—which townsfolk consider characteristic of the country—rumors of war are heard and painfully felt
My father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches
and children of the men who were going and should have heard the sobs
It seems as though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine Saviour
I have asked you never to warn me of the humor my father is in
the prince rested and the princess played the clavichord
From the far side of the house through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages—twenty times repeated—of a sonata by Dussek
Tíkhon knew that neither the son’s arrival nor any other unusual event must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day
who had only met once before for a short time at his wedding
were in each other’s arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to touch
Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her heart
but to the two women it seemed quite natural that they should cry
downy upper lip continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of glittering teeth and sparkling eyes
She told of an accident they had had on the Spásski Hill which might have been serious for her in her condition
Princess Mary was still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full of love and sadness
It was plain that she was following a train of thought independent of her sister-in-law’s words
asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which showed that
as if her lessons in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life
The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his son’s arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he dressed for dinner
The old prince always dressed in old-fashioned style
wearing an antique coat and powdered hair; and when Prince Andrew entered his father’s dressing room (not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing rooms
but with the animated face with which he talked to Pierre)
The old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner
Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot indicated to him
were to operate in Italy and on the Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English were to land at Naples
and how a total force of five hundred thousand men was to attack the French from different sides
The old prince did not evince the least interest during this explanation
and Mademoiselle Bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect
who generally kept very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important government officials to his table
had unexpectedly selected Michael Ivánovich (who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief) to illustrate the theory that all men are equals
and had more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael Ivánovich was  not a whit worse than you or I
which like all the rooms in the house was exceedingly lofty
containing the genealogical tree of the Princes Bolkónski
opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted portrait (evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate) of a ruling prince
Princess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brother’s criticism and was about to reply
when the expected footsteps were heard coming from the study
The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was his wont
as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners with the strict formality of his house
At that moment the great clock struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room
The prince stood still; his lively glittering eyes from under their thick
the sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around him
Michael Ivánovich did not at all know when  you and I  had said such things about Bonaparte
The old prince seemed convinced not only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the A B C of war or of politics
and that Bonaparte was an insignificant little Frenchy
successful only because there were no longer any Potëmkins or Suvórovs left to oppose him; but he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties in Europe and no real war
Prince Andrew gaily bore with his father’s ridicule of the new men
When you get there you’ll find out what those Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths are
could know and discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent European military and political events
The little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the dinner sat silent
glancing with a frightened look now at her father-in-law and now at Princess Mary
The little princess was in her sister-in-law’s room
Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him
two Turkish pistols and a saber—a present from his father who had brought it from the siege of Ochákov
When starting on a journey or changing their mode of life
men capable of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind
At such moments one reviews the past and plans for the future
Prince Andrew’s face looked very thoughtful and tender
With his hands behind him he paced briskly from corner to corner of the room
but evidently he did not wish to be seen in that mood
for hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his hands
stopped at a table as if tying the cover of the small box
and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable expression
but the princess noticed the ironical and contemptuous look that showed itself on his face
as we smile at those we think we thoroughly understand
putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what she was holding inside it
in the passage which connected one wing with the other
Prince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly came over his face
with such contempt that the Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word
so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole
Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch
said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter
these are my memoirs; hand them to the Emperor after my death
The old man’s sharp eyes were fixed straight on his son’s
came the frequent sound of the old man angrily blowing his nose
a Russian army was occupying the villages and towns of the Archduchy of Austria
and yet other regiments freshly arriving from Russia were settling near the fortress of Braunau and burdening the inhabitants on whom they were quartered
and hills in the distance—and despite the fact that the inhabitants (who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers) were not Russians
the regiment had just the appearance of any Russian regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia
On the evening of the last day’s march an order had been received that the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march
Though the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander
and the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or not
it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade order
were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing their eyes
while the adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned
and by morning the regiment—instead of the straggling
but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean shirt
But this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander
for in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the Austrian commissariat
and thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers
and wider from chest to back than across the shoulders
He had on a brand-new uniform showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders
He had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of his life
The battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed
to show the Austrian general the wretched state in which the troops arrived from Russia
Though the aide-de-camp did not know these circumstances
he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order
and that the commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied
the sergeants major began bustling (the greatcoats were not in very good condition)
throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps over their heads
The words passed along the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer
When the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in a cry of:  The general to the third company
the missing officer appeared from behind his company and
though he was a middle-aged man and not in the habit of running
trotted awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward the general
pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap
He was evidently pleased at his own display of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for wrath
shouted the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice
slightly creaking on its springs and drawn by six horses at a smart trot
and from the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals
bending forward and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements
and from the way he darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief
it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even greater zeal than his duty as a commander
Thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the regiment
Looking at their boots he several times shook his head sadly
pointing them out to the Austrian general with an expression which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone
but could not help noticing what a bad state of things it was
The regimental commander ran forward on each such occasion
These gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughed
with a grave face and without a smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes
the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same manner
Nesvítski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at the wag
recognizing the red-nosed captain who had been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat
One would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more than Timókhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental commander
The regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did not answer
The hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red-nosed captain and his drawn-in stomach
The officer evidently had complete control of his face
The clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as they had looked at the regimental commander
The same smile of the eyes with which he had turned from Captain Timókhin again flitted over his face
He turned away with a grimace as if to say that everything Dólokhov had said to him and everything he could say had long been known to him
which went to their appointed quarters near Braunau
overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and riding up to Captain Timókhin who was walking in front
laughing (the regimental commander was nicknamed King of Hearts)
This song had been composed in the Turkish campaign and now being sung in Austria
the only change being that the words  Father Kámenski  were replaced by  Father Kutúzov
handsome soldier of forty—looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes
Then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him
The commander in chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease
It was Dólokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that moment marching with the company
The hussar cornet of Kutúzov’s suite who had mimicked the regimental commander
Zherkóv had met Dólokhov abroad as a private and had not seen fit to recognize him
But now that Kutúzov had spoken to the gentleman ranker
The lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy gaiety with which Zherkóv spoke
arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness
asked for some papers relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival
Prince Andrew Bolkónski came into the room with the required papers
said he with a pleasant elegance of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken word
is that if the matter depended on my personal wishes
under the direction of so skillful a leader as General Mack
Though there was no definite news of an Austrian defeat
there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors that were afloat
and so Kutúzov’s suggestion of an Austrian victory sounded much like irony
But Kutúzov went on blandly smiling with the same expression
and frustrate his intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful ally
easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves
stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room
scarcely a trace was left of his former affected languor and indolence
He now looked like a man who has time to think of the impression he makes on others
but is occupied with agreeable and interesting work
His face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those around him
But among these people Prince Andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even feared him
But at that instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat
said the newly arrived general speaking quickly with a harsh German accent
producing a queer sound which immediately broke off
The door of the private room opened and Kutúzov appeared in the doorway
Kutúzov’s face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly immobile for a few moments
The report which had been circulated that the Austrians had been beaten and that the whole army had surrendered at Ulm proved to be correct
Prince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest lay in the general progress of the war
When he saw Mack and heard the details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost
understood all the difficulties of the Russian army’s position
and vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to play
see and take part in the first Russian encounter with the French since Suvórov met them
He feared that Bonaparte’s genius might outweigh all the courage of the Russian troops
and at the same time could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced
an Austrian general who on Kutúzov’s staff in charge of the provisioning of the Russian army
and the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous evening
looking as if they wished to avoid embarrassing attentions
pushed him away with an angry look and turned to Zherkóv
exclaimed Prince Andrew standing still in his excitement
Don’t you understand that either we are officers serving our Tsar and our country
rejoicing in the successes and grieving at the misfortunes of our common cause
or we are merely lackeys who care nothing for their master’s business
as if strengthening his views by this French sentence
(2) Only a hobbledehoy could amuse himself in this way
he added in Russian—but pronouncing the word with a French accent—having noticed that Zherkóv could still hear him
CHAPTER IV  The Pávlograd Hussars were stationed two miles from Braunau
The squadron in which Nicholas Rostóv served as a cadet was quartered in the German village of Salzeneck
the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news of Mack’s defeat
swung his leg over the saddle with a supple youthful movement
but Bondarénko had already thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse’s head
Though neither the German cleaning his cowshed nor Rostóv back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any reason for rejoicing
they looked at each other with joyful delight and brotherly love
Rostóv thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand which was offered him
Telyánin for some reason had been transferred from the Guards just before this campaign
(Rook was a young horse Telyánin had sold to Rostóv
The lieutenant explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters
When Rostóv went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the table
Denísov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of paper
He looked gloomily in Rostóv’s face and said:  I am witing to her
He leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and
There was an inn in the village which the officers frequented
Rostóv rode up to it and saw Telyánin’s horse at the porch
There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the room
No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives and the munching of the lieutenant
The lieutenant was looking about in his usual way and suddenly seemed to grow very merry
Telyánin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the pocket of his riding breeches
and from under his lifted brows he glanced into Rostóv’s eyes
and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn
Ask Denísov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand satisfaction of his regimental commander
He answered the staff captain’s question by a disapproving shake of his head
it’s not only to him but to the whole regiment—all of us—you’re to blame all round
The case is this: you ought to have thought the matter over and taken advice; but no
Have the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment
but occasionally looked with his glittering black eyes at Rostóv
destroying behind him the bridges over the rivers Inn (at Braunau) and Traun (near Linz)
and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the Enns and the Danube became visible
and the rocky left bank of the Danube covered with pine forests
with a mystic background of green treetops and bluish gorges
The turrets of a convent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest
and far away on the other side of the Enns the enemy’s horse patrols could be discerned
A Cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and a flask
who would have dearly liked to take another pie but felt shy
The faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound
and the movements of the approaching enemy farther off
At the same instant the sun came fully out from behind the clouds
and the clear sound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and spirited impression
who had alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the railings
which rippling and eddying round the piles of the bridge chased each other along
in a cloak and with a type of face different from that of the men
Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone before
and a healthy German girl with bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather beds
Evidently these fugitives were allowed to pass by special permission
The eyes of all the soldiers turned toward the women
The soldiers squeezed themselves to make way for him
but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg
actually drawing his saber from its scabbard and flourishing it
The imposing figure of Nesvítski followed by his Cossack
and the determination of Denísov who flourished his sword and shouted frantically
had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry
Having cleared the way Denísov stopped at the end of the bridge
spread across the bridge and began to emerge on his side of it
jested an hussar whose prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers
CHAPTER VIII  The last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge
Only Denísov’s squadron of hussars remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy
who could be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from the bridge
for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away
and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard from the hill
There was no one now between the squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers
and intangible line which separates two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt
and know that sooner or later it must be crossed and you will have to find out what is there
and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron
especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle; he was only redder than usual
With his shaggy head thrown back like birds when they drink
and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle
The squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without having lost a single man
came up to Denísov’s squadron and rode at a footpace not far from Rostóv
feeling that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that he had been to blame
It seemed to Rostóv that Bogdánich was only pretending not to notice him
and that his whole aim now was to test the cadet’s courage
so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily; then it seemed to him that Bogdánich rode so near in order to show him his courage
After his dismissal from headquarters Zherkóv had not remained in the regiment
saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff
and had succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to Prince Bagratión
but the prince told me to ‘go and tell the colonel that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge
’   Zherkóv was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the colonel of hussars with the same order
and now someone has gone and blundered; they are all beside themselves over there and one can’t make anything out
You must be quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot
he said in a solemn tone as if to announce that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still do the right thing
Striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame for everything
His hand trembled as he gave his horse into an orderly’s charge
Rostóv did not think what this call for stretchers meant; he ran on
Rostóv wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and was about to run on
Will they get there and fire the bridge or will the French get within grapeshot range and wipe them out
The hussars had succeeded in setting it on fire and the French batteries were now firing at them
no longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was someone to fire at
There was no one to hew down (as he had always imagined battles to himself)
when suddenly he heard a rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt
With what soft glitter the waters of the distant Danube shone
and pronouncing the phrase  knocked out  with ringing distinctness
CHAPTER IX  Pursued by the French army of a hundred thousand men under the command of Bonaparte
and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had been foreseen
the Russian army of thirty-five thousand men commanded by Kutúzov was hurriedly retreating along the Danube
and Melk; but despite the courage and endurance—acknowledged even by the enemy—with which the Russians fought
the only consequence of these actions was a yet more rapid retreat
Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and had joined Kutúzov at Braunau now separated from the Russian army
and Kutúzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces
carefully prepared in accord with the modern science of strategics
had been handed to Kutúzov when he was in Vienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath
and stragglers; though a number of sick and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the Danube with a letter in which Kutúzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy; and though the big hospitals and the houses in Krems converted into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded
yet the stand made at Krems and the victory over Mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably
His horse had been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet
As a mark of the commander in chief’s special favor he was sent with the news of this victory to the Austrian court
now no longer at Vienna (which was threatened by the French) but at Brünn
he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to Brünn
picturing pleasantly to himself the impression his news of a victory would create
or recalling the send-off given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers
Prince Andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a man who has at length begun to attain a long-desired happiness
As soon as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of victory
Then he began to imagine that the Russians were running away and that he himself was killed
but he quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy
as if learning afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary the French had run away
At one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of Russian wounded
Prince Andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and alert than he had done the day before
Only his eyes gleamed feverishly and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and rapidity
but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself stating them to the Emperor Francis
Five minutes later he returned and bowing with particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrew before him along a corridor to the cabinet where the Minister of War was at work
The adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any attempt at familiarity on the part of the Russian messenger
and without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into one of disdain which was quite uncalled for
he entered the room of the Minister of War with peculiarly deliberate steps
This feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencil notes on them
and for the first two or three minutes taking no notice of his arrival
handing him the papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger
Prince Andrew felt that either the actions of Kutúzov’s army interested the Minister of War less than any of the other matters he was concerned with
but the instant he turned to Prince Andrew the firm
intelligent expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and habitual to him
When Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the indifferent hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant
The whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed; the battle seemed the memory of a remote event long past
CHAPTER X  Prince Andrew stayed at Brünn with Bilíbin
After his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life
but had become more intimate when Prince Andrew was in Vienna with Kutúzov
Just as Prince Andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high in the military profession
so to an even greater extent Bilíbin gave promise of rising in his diplomatic career
He still a young man but no longer a young diplomat
Both the foreign minister and our ambassador in Vienna knew him and valued him
What the diplomatic matter might be he did not care
Bilíbin’s services were valued not only for what he wrote
In society he always awaited an opportunity to say something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was possible
These sayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally
which always looked as clean and well washed as the tips of one’s fingers after a Russian bath
The movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play of expression on his face
Now his forehead would pucker into deep folds and his eyebrows were lifted
described the engagement and his reception by the Minister of War
examining his nails from a distance and puckering the skin above his left eye
malgré la haute estime que je professe pour the Orthodox Russian army
with all my respect for the Orthodox      Russian army
You ought to have been there at seven in the morning
destroying the spell of the invincibility of the French
Bring us nice news of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand (one archduke’s as good as another
as you know) and even if it is only over a fire brigade of Bonaparte’s
that will be another story and we’ll fire off some cannon
what effect would that have on the general course of events
What of the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and Prince Auersperg
the bridge has not yet been taken and I hope it will not be
for it is mined and orders have been given to blow it up
Otherwise we should long ago have been in the mountains of Bohemia
and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour between two fires
Austria’s hand will be forced and there will be war
and all this for the beaux yeux   of His Sardinian Majesty
And therefore—this is between ourselves—I instinctively feel that we are being deceived
his face again becoming smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end
When Prince Andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows
of musketry and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears
they asked him a few questions about the army and the battle
Kurágin is exquisite when he discusses politics—you should see his gravity
He sat down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking to him about politics
Prince Andrew and the others gathered round these two
The Berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance
CHAPTER XII  At the levee Prince Andrew stood among the Austrian officers as he had been told to
the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed Bolkónski that the Emperor desired to give him an audience
The Emperor Francis received him standing in the middle of the room
Prince Andrew withdrew and was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides
Everywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words
he was returning to Bilíbin’s house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit to Brünn
was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of the front door
the French have crossed the bridge that Auersperg was defending
‘you know the Thabor Bridge is mined and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its head and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us cross
As soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it out of this position; that here was the Toulon that would lift him from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame
Listening to Bilíbin he was already imagining how on reaching the army he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one that could save the army
and meanwhile a French battalion gets to the bridge unobserved
and he is so flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the French marshals
his excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story
seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak
turns to Auersperg with feigned astonishment (he is a true Gascon) and says: ‘I don’t recognize the world-famous Austrian discipline
His hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure
And in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles vanished from his face
You have not been ordered to return and have not been dismissed from here; therefore
either you will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded
not knowing where he would find it and fearing to be captured by the French on the way to Krems
In Brünn everybody attached to the court was packing up
and the heavy baggage was already being dispatched to Olmütz
Near Hetzelsdorf Prince Andrew struck the high road along which the Russian army was moving with great haste and in the greatest disorder
The road was so obstructed with carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage
rode in search of the commander in chief and of his own luggage
Very sinister reports of the position of the army reached him as he went along
and the appearance of the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors
Cette armée russe que l’or de l’Angleterre a transportée des extrémités de l’univers
nous allons lui faire éprouver le même sort—(le sort de l’armée d’Ulm)
He remembered these words in Bonaparte’s address to his army at the beginning of the campaign
That Russian army which has been brought from the ends of      the earth by English gold
we shall cause to share the same      fate—(the fate of the army at Ulm)
At each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the din of shouting more incessant
The officers directing the march rode backward and forward between the carts
Directly opposite to him came a strange one-horse vehicle
and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the apron under the leather hood of the vehicle
Prince Andrew rode up and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle
An officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving the woman’s vehicle for trying to get ahead of others
Prince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless
tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying
He saw that his championship of the doctor’s wife in her queer trap might expose him to what he dreaded more than anything in the world—to ridicule; but his instinct urged him on
The officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away
and recalling with a sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he galloped on to the village where he was told that the commander in chief was
Prince Andrew saw Nesvítski and another adjutant having something to eat
They hastily turned round to him asking if he had any news
On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm
and he went off to the house where the commander in chief was
Passing by Kutúzov’s carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his suite
was in the house with Prince Bagratión and Weyrother
Weyrother was the Austrian general who had succeeded Schmidt
Kozlóvski’s face looked worn—he too had evidently not slept all night
the fact that the clerk and Kozlóvski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander in chief
and from the noisy laughter of the Cossacks holding the horses near the window
and Kutúzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway
Prince Andrew stood right in front of Kutúzov but the expression of the commander in chief’s one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence
as if with an old man’s penetration he understood all that was passing in Bolkónski’s mind
With delicate irony he questioned Prince Andrew about the details of his interview with the Emperor
Napoleon’s army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand
and he would find himself in the position of Mack at Ulm
If Kutúzov decided to abandon the road connecting him with the troops arriving from Russia
he would have to march with no road into unknown parts of the Bohemian mountains
defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning all hope of a junction with Buxhöwden
But to forestall the French with his whole army was impossible
and if he succeeded in forestalling the French he was to delay them as long as possible
Kutúzov himself with all his transport took the road to Znaim
and losing a third of his men as stragglers by the way
Bagratión came out on the Vienna-Znaim road at Hollabrünn a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching Hollabrünn from Vienna
The success of the trick that had placed the Vienna bridge in the hands of the French without a fight led Murat to try to deceive Kutúzov in a similar way
Meeting Bagratión’s weak detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be Kutúzov’s whole army
To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna
and with this object offered a three days’ truce on condition that both armies should remain in position without moving
Murat declared that negotiations for peace were already proceeding
Another emissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the Russian army the three days’ truce
Wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation
which alone covered this movement of the transport and of the whole army
had to remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself
Kutúzov’s expectations that the proposals of capitulation (which were in no way binding) might give time for part of the transport to pass
sixteen miles from Hollabrünn) received Murat’s dispatch with the proposal of a truce and a capitulation
and have no right to arrange an armistice without my order
You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign
Break the armistice immediately and march on the enemy
Inform him that the general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so
The Austrians let themselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna bridge
you are letting yourself be tricked by an aide-de-camp of the Emperor
cooked their porridge for the first time for three days
and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store for him
arrived at Grunth and reported himself to Bagratión
Bonaparte’s adjutant had not yet reached Murat’s detachment and the battle had not yet begun
In Bagratión’s detachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs
knowing Bolkónski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant
received him with distinction and special marks of favor
explaining to him that there would probably be an engagement that day or the next
asked the prince’s permission to ride round the position to see the disposition of the forces
elegantly dressed man with a diamond ring on his forefinger
let’s go in and I will get myself a roll and some cheese
said the staff officer trying to preserve his gravity
continually meeting and overtaking soldiers and officers of various regiments
said the staff officer indicating the highest point
The greatest disorder and depression had been in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the Znaim road seven miles away from the French
At Grunth also some apprehension and alarm could be felt
but the nearer Prince Andrew came to the French lines the more confident was the appearance of our troops
The soldiers in their greatcoats were ranged in lines
the sergeants major and company officers were counting the men
poking the last man in each section in the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up
filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him
and walked away from the sergeant major with brightened expressions
licking their lips and wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats
All their faces were as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful encampment
and not within sight of the enemy before an action in which at least half of them would be left on the field
Prince Andrew came out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man
Our front line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks
but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that morning
the lines were so near together that the men could see one another’s faces and speak to one another
The soldier to whom the laughers referred was Dólokhov
Prince Andrew recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying
was trying to prove that the Russians had surrendered and had fled all the way from Ulm
came peals of such healthy and good-humored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the French involuntarily
the loopholes in blockhouses and entrenchments looked out just as menacingly
and the unlimbered cannon confronted one another as before
CHAPTER XVI  Having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left
and stopped beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon
newly constructed wattle shed from which came the sound of officers’ voices in eager conversation
and in three places to left and right the French troops amid the smoke of their campfires
but it was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye
where Túshin’s battery stood and from which Prince Andrew was surveying the position
closely following the mass movements and general orders
and constantly studying historical accounts of battles
involuntarily pictured to himself the course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline
the Kiev grenadiers and the Podólsk chasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the center come up
as if it had not finished saying what was necessary
rushed out of the shed followed by the owner of the manly voice
CHAPTER XVII  Mounting his horse again Prince Andrew lingered with the battery
Prince Andrew turned his horse and galloped back to Grunth to find Prince Bagratión
had at once moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the Russian wings
Passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking vodka a quarter of an hour before
he saw everywhere the same rapid movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready
was what the face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say
waiting for him to come up; Prince Bagratión reined in his horse and recognizing Prince Andrew nodded to him
said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning smile
as if flattered at being made the subject of Zherkóv’s joke
It was an old-fashioned saber of a kind no longer in general use
Prince Andrew remembered the story of Suvórov giving his saber to Bagratión in Italy
and the recollection was particularly pleasant at that moment
a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his suite
Though Túshin’s guns had been intended to cannonade the valley
he was firing incendiary balls at the village of Schön Grabern visible just opposite
in front of which large masses of French were advancing
the officer of the suite pointed out to Bagratión a French column that was outflanking us
To the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood
Prince Bagratión ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the right flank
Prince Bagratión turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked at him in silence
It seemed to Prince Andrew that the officer’s remark was just and that really no answer could be made to it
But at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of the French were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in disorder and was retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers
Prince Bagratión bowed his head in sign of assent and approval
He rode off at a walk to the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the French
But this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the commander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in the ground
as a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing men uselessly
and as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there himself
Prince Bagratión sent Zherkóv to tell the general in command (the one who had paraded his regiment before Kutúzov at Braunau) that he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear
as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemy’s attack very long
About Túshin and the battalion that had been in support of his battery all was forgotten
having reached the highest point of our right flank
began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where on account of the smoke nothing could be seen
One with a bleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who supported him under the arms
There was a gurgle in his throat and he was spitting blood
A bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or mouth
Another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket
groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt
while blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle
He had that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering
Crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men lying on the ground; they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were unwounded
The soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily
and despite the general’s presence were talking loudly and gesticulating
In front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke
Bagratión rode up to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there
though who they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no wind to carry away
rode up to Bagratión and welcomed him as a host welcomes an honored guest
employing this military term to describe what had occurred to his regiment
but in reality he did not himself know what had happened during that half-hour to the troops entrusted to him
and could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his regiment had been broken up
but at French infantry who had come into the hollow and were firing at our men
Prince Bagratión bowed his head as a sign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected
Turning to his adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs whom they had just passed
Prince Andrew was struck by the changed expression on Prince Bagratión’s face at this moment
hawk’s eyes looked before him eagerly and rather disdainfully
not resting on anything although his movements were still slow and measured
The commander of the regiment turned to Prince Bagratión
but Bagratión did not reply; he only gave an order to cease firing and re-form
with a stupid and happy expression—the same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed
he stepped lightly with his muscular legs as if sailing along
stretching himself to his full height without the smallest effort
his ease contrasting with the heavy tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him
the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in step
A morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on Bagratión as he shouted
he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of a cavalryman
Prince Bagratión gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in front of the ranks
and passing Bagratión and racing one another they rushed in an irregular but joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe
But our left—which consisted of the Azóv and Podólsk infantry and the Pávlograd hussars—was simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior French forces under Lannes and was thrown into confusion
But no sooner had he left Bagratión than his courage failed him
The command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of the regiment Kutúzov had reviewed at Braunau and in which Dólokhov was serving as a private
The two commanders were much exasperated with one another and
long after the action had begun on the right flank and the French were already advancing
From privates to general they were not expecting a battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations
while the capotes of Lannes’ sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and forming up within twice the range of a musket shot
The general in command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps
and having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the Pávlograd commander
I am not considering my own pleasure and I won’t allow it to be said
for from where they had been before it had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground
as well as that the French were outflanking our left
The general and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks preparing for battle
and neither wished to give occasion for it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire
they would have remained there for a long time testing each other’s courage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry and a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood
The French had attacked the men collecting wood in the copse
It was no longer possible for the hussars to retreat with the infantry
it was now necessary to attack in order to cut a way through for themselves
there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy
but the rumor of an attack spread through the squadron
felt that the commander did not himself know what to do
and Rostóv felt Rook’s flanks drooping as he broke into a gallop
This tree had been in the middle of the line that had seemed so terrible—and now he had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible
In among the hindmost of these men wearing similar shakos was a Russian hussar
and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack them to pieces
flung it at the Frenchman and ran with all his might toward the bushes
He did not now run with the feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the Enns bridge
The moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind
an exemplary officer of many years’ service who had never been to blame
That moment of moral hesitation which decides the fate of battles had arrived
Despite his desperate shouts that used to seem so terrible to the soldiers
The moral hesitation which decided the fate of battles was evidently culminating in a panic
to order the battery to retire as quickly as possible
When the supports attached to Túshin’s battery had been moved away in the middle of the action by someone’s order
The French columns that had advanced beyond the village went back; but as though in revenge for this failure
aroused by the fire and their luck in successfully cannonading the French
and the four guns were turned against the ten-gun battery
Túshin’s companion officer had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour seventeen of the forty men of the guns’ crews had been disabled
deafened by the incessant reports which always made him jump
a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their officer—all looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing situation
and the expression on his face was invariably reflected on theirs
Owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and activity
Túshin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of fear
since he had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot
and did everything the best of officers could do in his position
he was in a state akin to feverish delirium or drunkenness
from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded him pleasure
The first thing he saw on riding up to the space where Túshin’s guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a broken leg
One ball after another passed over as he approached and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine
He delivered the order and did not leave the battery
They were both so busy as to seem not to notice one another
When having limbered up the only two cannon that remained uninjured out of the four
continually driving round or coming upon wounded men
many of them dragged themselves after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages
the gun from which they had removed the dead officer
It was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the infantry
and having reached the village of Gruntersdorf they halted
it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing always in one direction
the groans and voices of the wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness of the night
The gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their groans
The whole moving mass began pressing closer together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt: evidently those in front had halted
All remained where they were in the middle of the muddy road
sent a soldier to find a dressing station or a doctor for the cadet
intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and commiseration on Rostóv
who saw that Túshin with his whole heart wished to help him but could not
but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm
an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to the bonfire
talking with some commanding officers who had gathered at his quarters
The little old man with the half-closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone
and the general who had served blamelessly for twenty-two years
with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes
In a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the French
and the accountant with the naïve face was feeling its texture
to look on at a dinner where there was no place for him
Prince Bagratión was thanking the individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our losses
I stopped in the road and thought: ‘I’ll let them come on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion’—and that’s what I did
though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie devoid of any foundation
Prince Bagratión turned to the old colonel:   Gentlemen
feeling embarrassed as he always was by the sight of his superiors
did his guilt and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present themselves to Túshin in all their horror
He was afraid of getting some other officer into trouble
found nothing to say; the others did not venture to intervene
Prince Andrew broke the silence with his abrupt voice
you were pleased to send me to Captain Túshin’s battery
and Telyánin and all that affair with Telyánin and Bogdánich
That affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh voice
and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly
but they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hair’s breadth
The black canopy of night hung less than a yard above the glow of the charcoal
Next day the French army did not renew their attack
and the remnant of Bagratión’s detachment was reunited to Kutúzov’s army
BOOK THREE: 1805      CHAPTER I  Prince Vasíli was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans
Still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage
He was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had become a habit
I must entice him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles I need
But when he came across a man of position his instinct immediately told him that this man could be useful
He had Pierre at hand in Moscow and procured for him an appointment as Gentleman of the Bedchamber
which at that time conferred the status of Councilor of State
yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing
Prince Vasíli did everything to get Pierre to marry his daughter
Had he thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural and shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both above and below him in social standing
on unexpectedly becoming Count Bezúkhov and a rich man
and acquaintances alike—were all disposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering manner: they were all evidently firmly convinced of Pierre’s noble qualities
till he began sincerely to believe in his own exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence
the more so as in the depth of his heart it had always seemed to him that he really was very kind and intelligent
handing him a deed to sign for the princess’ benefit
Prince Vasíli had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw this bone—a bill for thirty thousand rubles—to the poor princess that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of the inlaid portfolio
Pierre signed the deed and after that the princess grew still kinder
who often made him feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him
It seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like him
and it would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him
he had no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not
He was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful intoxication
He felt as though he were the center of some important and general movement; that something was constantly expected of him
all would be well; and he did what was demanded of him
Prince Vasíli took possession of Pierre’s affairs and of Pierre himself in those early days
and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of weariness and assurance
as if he were adding every time:  You know I am overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that I trouble myself about you
speaking as if he were saying something which had long since been agreed upon and could not now be altered
But Prince Vasíli interrupted him in the special deep cooing tone
precluding the possibility of interrupting his speech
But you will see everything for yourself when you get to Petersburg
Of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in Petersburg
The Guards had gone to the front; Dólokhov had been reduced to the ranks; Anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces; Prince Andrew was abroad; so Pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he used to like to spend them
or to open his mind by intimate talks with a friend older than himself and whom he respected
that remarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became foolish as soon as he uttered them
he could see that she wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modesty
only the novelty she offered her guests this time was not Mortemart
but a diplomatist fresh from Berlin with the very latest details of the Emperor Alexander’s visit to Potsdam
and of how the two august friends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold the cause of justice against the enemy of the human race
Anna Pávlovna received Pierre with a shade of melancholy
evidently relating to the young man’s recent loss by the death of Count Bezúkhov (everyone constantly considered it a duty to assure Pierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known)
it was just of her beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in society
The old aunt received the two young people in her corner
and said in French that she was very pleased to see Hélène
was so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive the living charm of her neck and shoulders
He did not see her marble beauty forming a complete whole with her dress
but all the charm of her body only covered by her garments
And having once seen this he could not help being aware of it
just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once seen through
He had merely understood that the woman he had known as a child
I have been told that her brother Anatole was in love with her and she with him
but while he was thinking this (the reflection was still incomplete)
he caught himself smiling and was conscious that another line of thought had sprung up
and how all he had thought and heard of her might be false
And he again saw her not as the daughter of Prince Vasíli
He recalled her former words and looks and the words and looks of those who had seen them together
He recalled Anna Pávlovna’s words and looks when she spoke to him about his house
bound himself to do something that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do
But at the very time he was expressing this conviction to himself
Prince Vasíli had to go on a tour of inspection in four different provinces
He had arranged this for himself so as to visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son Anatole where his regiment was stationed
and take him to visit Prince Nicholas Bolkónski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that rich old man
had not left Prince Vasíli’s and felt with terror that in people’s eyes he was every day more and more connected with her
and that though it would be a terrible thing he would have to unite his fate with hers
He had often begun to make reflections or think aloud in her company
and she had always answered him either by a brief but appropriate remark—showing that it did not interest her—or by a silent look and smile which more palpably than anything else showed Pierre her superiority
She was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile
She always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him alone
in which there was something more significant than in the general smile that usually brightened her face
Pierre knew that everyone was waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line
and he knew that sooner or later he would step across it
but an incomprehensible terror seized him at the thought of that dreadful step
but felt with dismay that in this matter he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really possessed
Pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel themselves quite innocent
and since that day when he was overpowered by a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at Anna Pávlovna’s
a small party of just their own people—as his wife said—met for supper at Prince Vasíli’s
the old chamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately
had received and read the then famous rescript of the Emperor Alexander from the army to Sergéy Kuzmích
in which the Emperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of the people’s loyalty
that the declaration from Petersburg gave him particular pleasure
and that he was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor to be worthy of it
everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the influence of a variety of exciting sensations
and however they avoided looking at the young couple
and heedless and unobservant as they seemed of them
and that the whole attention of that company was directed to—Pierre and Hélène
Prince Vasíli mimicked the sobbing of Sergéy Kuzmích and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his daughter
Prince Vasíli read a congratulation on his future son-in-law and on his daughter’s happiness
and artificial interests uniting that society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy and handsome young man and woman for one another
Not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at table seemed to feel this
glancing at those dazzling shoulders close to his eyes
Or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what
Suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a second time
as if unwilling to distract her from an important occupation
The diplomatist preserved a mournful silence as he left the drawing room
He pictured the vanity of his diplomatic career in comparison with Pierre’s happiness
she was tormented by jealousy of her daughter’s happiness
but he could not make up his mind to take the final step
he began by asking her whether she was satisfied with the party
turning instantly to his daughter and addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to parents who have petted their children from babyhood
It seemed to Pierre that even the prince was disconcerted
asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properly
of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money
My son Anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army
Prince Bolkónski was particularly discontented and out of temper
Whether he was in a bad temper because Prince Vasíli was coming
She thought:  If I seem not to notice he will think that I do not sympathize with him; if I seem sad and out of spirits myself
he will say (as he has done before) that I’m in the dumps
she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne:  Heaven knows what a fright might do
In general at Bald Hills the little princess lived in constant fear
dragged his sleighs up to one of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow
sat with arms akimbo before a table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent-mindedly fixed his large and handsome eyes
He regarded his whole life as a continual round of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him
not only was it known in the maidservants’ rooms that the minister and his son had arrived
The mere thought of her father’s look filled her with terror
it was still more noticeable how much plainer she had become
and hurriedly and merrily began to devise and carry out a plan of how Princess Mary should be dressed
Princess Mary’s self-esteem was wounded by the fact that the arrival of a suitor agitated her
and still more so by both her companions’ not having the least conception that it could be otherwise
To tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to betray her agitation
and it took on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore
as she submitted herself to Mademoiselle Bourienne and Lise
Both these women quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty
but the face and whole figure of Princess Mary that was not pretty
They forgot that the frightened face and the figure could not be altered
After two or three changes to which Princess Mary meekly submitted
now adjusting a fold of the dress with her little hand
a strong dominant and strangely attractive being rose in her imagination
her own—such as she had seen the day before in the arms of her nurse’s daughter—at her own breast
and before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and
her eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit by a lamp
thinking neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say
What could all that matter in comparison with the will of God
Prince Vasíli and his son were already in the drawing room
over which was beautiful light-brown hair smelling of pomade
When she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty
Perhaps he did not really think this when he met women—even probably he did not
thanks to Princess Lise’s voice and little downy lip that lifted over her white teeth
She met Prince Vasíli with that playful manner often employed by lively chatty people
though no such reminiscences really exist—just as none existed in this case
into these amusing recollections of things that had never occurred
Mademoiselle Bourienne also shared them and even Princess Mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these merry reminiscences
turning to his son and seizing the little princess’ arm as if she would have run away and he had just managed to catch her
Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part seized the opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections
The question was whether he could ever bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband
The prince never directly asked himself that question
knowing beforehand that he would have to answer it justly
and yet the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer
Prince Vasíli had brought his son with the evident intention of proposing
and looked at him with curiosity and perfect composure
waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had told him to expect
pointed to it and began questioning him about political affairs and news
You have done up your hair in this new way for the visitors
As always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time without male society
Princess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure
I try to be reserved because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him already
did not intend to devote her life to serving Prince Bolkónski
to reading aloud to him and being friends with Princess Mary
Mademoiselle Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian prince who
and to whom her poor mother (sa pauvre mère) appeared
and reproached her for yielding to a man without being married
He would carry her away and then sa pauvre mère would appear and he would marry her
So her future shaped itself in Mademoiselle Bourienne’s head at the very time she was talking to Anatole about Paris
Although in female society Anatole usually assumed the role of a man tired of being run after by women
Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion
referred not to her but to the movements of Mademoiselle Bourienne’s little foot
which he was then touching with his own under the clavichord
Mademoiselle Bourienne was also looking at Princess Mary
but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her shortsighted eyes
Is it possible that Amélie  (Mademoiselle Bourienne)  thinks I could be jealous of her
it seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark corner
She rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room
now working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mère rebuking her for her fall
The little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made
and her burden oppressed her now more than ever because Anatole’s presence had vividly recalled to her the time when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay
The old prince felt as though he had been insulted through his daughter
He kept telling himself that he would consider the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act
but instead of that he only excited himself more and more
The first man that turns up—she forgets her father and everything else
If she has no pride for herself she might at least have some for my sake
The old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a mistake and that Anatole meant to flirt with Mademoiselle Bourienne
Tíkhon knew his master’s habit of sometimes thinking aloud
instinctively knew the direction of his master’s thoughts
Though no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle Bourienne
they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance
up to the appearance of the pauvre mère; they understood that they had much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an opportunity since morning to meet one another alone
When Princess Mary went to her father’s room at the usual hour
Mademoiselle Bourienne and Anatole met in the conservatory
Princess Mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation
She read this in Tíkhon’s face and in that of Prince Vasíli’s valet
who made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot water
The old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of his daughter that morning
Princess Mary well knew this painstaking expression of her father’s
His face wore that expression when his dry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in arithmetic
when rising from his chair he would walk away from her
I expect you have guessed that Prince Vasíli has not come and brought his pupil with him  (for some reason Prince Bolkónski referred to Anatole as a  pupil )  for the sake of my beautiful eyes
The princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval
but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be decided now or never
He saw the effect these words had produced on his daughter
as if inviting her to join in a laugh at this strange incident
Tíkhon came to call Princess Mary to the old prince; he added that Prince Vasíli was also there
When Tíkhon came to her Princess Mary was sitting on the sofa in her room
holding the weeping Mademoiselle Bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair
with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in his hand
was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face
frowning and taking his daughter’s hand; he did not kiss her
but only bending his forehead to hers just touched it
I will do all I can to arrange the match between them
CHAPTER VI  It was long since the Rostóvs had news of Nicholas
who always knew everything that passed in the house
with her own handkerchief wiped the tears from his eyes and from the letter
then having dried her own eyes she comforted the count
At dinner Anna Mikháylovna talked the whole time about the war news and about Nikólenka
and remarked that they might very likely be getting a letter from him that day
Each time that these hints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count and at Anna Mikháylovna
seeing the impression the news of her brother’s wound produced on Sónya
It’s because she was in love with that fat one in spectacles  (that was how Pétya described his namesake
the scarcely perceptible motion of whose tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her
that son about whom she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count
that son who had first learned to say  pear  and then  granny
that this son should now be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings
rough drafts of letters to Nicholas from all the household were written and copied out
while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the count
had even managed by favor with army authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself and her son
and that if a letter reached the Grand Duke in command of the Guards there was no reason why it should not reach the Pávlograd regiment
which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood
That day Nicholas Rostóv received a letter from Borís
telling him that the Ismáylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from Olmütz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for him
celebrating awards they had received for the campaign
and made expeditions to Olmütz to visit a certain Caroline the Hungarian
The Don horse he was riding was one he had bought from a Cossack during the campaign
and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his head
As he rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress Borís and all his comrades of the Guards by his appearance—that of a fighting hussar who had been under fire
and the Austrian authorities had provided excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place
The regiments had entered and left the town with their bands playing
had made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him
and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from Pierre had become acquainted with Prince Andrew Bolkónski
and wish to express itself in a manner different from that of its elders which is often insincere
quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken those first steps
And the Tsarévich was very gracious to all our officers
And the two friends told each other of their doings
the one of his hussar revels and life in the fighting line
and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face
In the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation to Bagratión which the old countess at Anna Mikháylovna’s advice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son
He looked intently and inquiringly into his friend’s eyes
and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers became animated
kept silent when the subject did not relate to himself
but in connection with the stories of the Grand Duke’s quick temper he related with gusto how in Galicia he had managed to deal with the Grand Duke when the latter made a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement
Rostóv was a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate lie
would have thought that Rostóv was himself to blame since what generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened to him
the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled
we will talk of it later  (and he looked round at Rostóv)
whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to anger he did not condescend to notice
and I am ready to agree with you that it would be very easy to do so if you haven’t sufficient self-respect
but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen
Only when Prince Andrew was gone did Rostóv think of what he ought to have said
He thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered by his pistol
and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew there was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very adjutant whom he so hated
CHAPTER VIII  The day after Rostóv had been to see Borís
a review was held of the Austrian and Russian troops
spreading out with the brazen clatter of the polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with the smell of linstocks
but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and his weapons clean and polished to the utmost
and yet at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that enormous whole
A space like a street was left between each two lines of troops
The three parts of that army were sharply distinguished: Kutúzov’s fighting army (with the Pávlograds on the right flank of the front); those recently arrived from Russia
a light gust of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs
this was repeated by others from various sides and all became silent
and the trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march
standing in the front lines of Kutúzov’s army which the Tsar approached first
and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this triumph
its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had already passed
Through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices
amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to stone
he experienced a feeling of tenderness and ecstasy such as he had never before known
Rostóv involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still stronger flow of love for his sovereign
He longed to show that love in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry
his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling himself one with his horse
especially if the Essen corps arrived and Prussia took our side
But the talk in every group was chiefly about the Emperor Alexander
His every word and movement was described with ecstasy
They all had but one wish: to advance as soon as possible against the enemy under the Emperor’s command
Commanded by the Emperor himself they could not fail to vanquish anyone
be it whom it might: so thought Rostóv and most of the officers after the review
wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the best post he could—preferably that of adjutant to some important personage
whose father sends him ten thousand rubles at a time
to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyone’s lackey
laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him
None of these gentlemen changed his position on seeing Borís
his eyes drooping contemptuously (with that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says
If it were not my duty I would not talk to you for a moment )
as if he understood what Prince Andrew was alluding to as something generally known
While Prince Andrew went to report about the purple-faced general
that gentleman—evidently not sharing Borís’ conception of the advantages of the unwritten code of subordination—looked so fixedly at the presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to say to the adjutant that Borís felt uncomfortable
So we will go to Dolgorúkov; I have to go there anyhow and I have already spoken to him about you
We shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you somewhere nearer the sun
Prince Andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young man and help him to worldly success
he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and which attracted him
He very readily took up Borís’ cause and went with him to Dolgorúkov
It was late in the evening when they entered the palace at Olmütz occupied by the Emperors and their retinues
contrary to the views of the old generals Kutúzov and Prince Schwartzenberg
it had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to Bonaparte
The council of war was just over when Prince Andrew accompanied by Borís arrived at the palace to find Dolgorúkov
the troops inspired by the Emperors’ presence were eager for action
but Prince Dolgorúkov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to Borís and
no conditions better than our present ones could have been devised
it seems to me that Bonaparte has decidedly lost bearings
’ it seemed to me it should be to ‘General Bonaparte
he’s dined with him—the present Emperor—more than once in Paris
and tells me he never met a more cunning or subtle diplomatist—you know
getting up hurriedly and pressing the hands of Prince Andrew and Borís
You know I should be very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young man
Borís was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers as he felt himself to be at that moment
gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression
This short man nodded to Dolgorúkov as to an intimate friend and stared at Prince Andrew with cool intensity
walking straight toward him and evidently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way
and after going behind other columns for about two thirds of a mile was stopped on the highroad
Rostóv saw the Cossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then Generals Bagratión and Dolgorúkov ride past with their adjutants
and saw wounded being brought back (there were not many of them)
The men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory
of the occupation of the town of Wischau and the capture of a whole French squadron
The day was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost
and the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyed
not only by the tales of those who had taken part in it
indicating a captive French dragoon who was being brought in on foot by two Cossacks
The officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and their prisoner
It was plain that he did not quite grasp where he was
insisted on his soldierly discipline and zeal in the service
said the Alsatian good-naturedly to Rostóv when the animal was handed over to the hussar
Rostóv did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted
He was filled with happiness at his nearness to the Emperor
He felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the day he had lost
He felt it not only from the sound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade
Nearer and nearer to Rostóv came that sun shedding beams of mild and majestic light around
the Emperor’s eyes met Rostóv’s and rested on them for not more than two seconds
Whether or no the Emperor understood what was going on in Rostóv’s soul (it seemed to Rostóv that he understood everything)
which consisted in the capture of a French squadron
especially while the smoke hung over the battlefield
where there had been some rather heavy firing before the Emperor’s arrival
a different one from that which he had ridden at the review
and revolting that his proximity to the Emperor shocked Rostóv
Rostóv saw how the Emperor’s rather round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them
how his left foot began convulsively tapping the horse’s side with the spur
which all day long had yielded ground to us at the least firing
The campfires crackled and the soldiers’ songs resounded even more merrily than on the previous night
shouted enthusiastically and no less sincerely than the twenty-year-old Rostóv
And Rostóv got up and went wandering among the campfires
He really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms and the hope of future triumph
and an hour later he rode off with Prince Dolgorúkov to the advanced post of the French army
the army advanced two days’ march and the enemy’s outposts after a brief interchange of shots retreated
the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the army
and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth
the whole eighty thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voices
and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles long
an impulse once given leads to the final result; and just as indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet reached
Wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement
the result of the complicated motion of innumerable wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the hands which show the time
and enthusiasm—was only the loss of the battle of Austerlitz
the so-called battle of the three Emperors—that is to say
a slow movement of the hand on the dial of human history
Bolkónski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the coming action from Dolgorúkov
He felt that Kutúzov was upset and dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were dissatisfied with him
But they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he talks sense
evidently prizing this general conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with Napoleon
And Prince Dolgorúkov rapidly but indistinctly explained Weyrother’s plan of a flanking movement
but for the disadvantage that Weyrother’s had already been approved
As soon as Prince Andrew began to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan
CHAPTER XII  Shortly after nine o’clock that evening
Weyrother drove with his plans to Kutúzov’s quarters where the council of war was to be held
by his eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied and drowsy Kutúzov
who reluctantly played the part of chairman and president of the council of war
Weyrother evidently felt himself to be at the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable
He was like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart
Whether he was pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know
but rushed along at headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead to
though at the same time he was haughty and self-confident
Kutúzov was occupying a nobleman’s castle of modest dimensions near Ostralitz
and only awaited Prince Bagratión to begin the council
At last Bagratión’s orderly came with the news that the prince could not attend
Prince Andrew came in to inform the commander in chief of this and
and nodding his head he let it droop and again closed his eye
If at first the members of the council thought that Kutúzov was pretending to sleep
monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the impending battle
The dispositions were very complicated and difficult
it is advantageous to attack the enemy’s latter wing especially if we occupy the villages of Sokolnitz and Kobelnitz
whereby we can both fall on his flank and pursue him over the plain between Schlappanitz and the Thuerassa forest
and only turned away his eyes when the Austrian chief of staff finished reading
Then Milorádovich looked round significantly at the other generals
with a subtle smile that never left his typically southern French face during the whole time of the reading
but now be so good as to look at the map and listen
Langeron lifted his eyes with an expression of perplexity
turned round to Milorádovich as if seeking an explanation
and stooping over the outspread map conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality
without looking at Weyrother or at anyone in particular
but with men who could teach him something in military matters
When the monotonous sound of Weyrother’s voice ceased
trying as virulently as possible to sting Weyrother’s vanity as author of the military plan
argued that Bonaparte might easily attack instead of being attacked
and so render the whole of this plan perfectly worthless
Weyrother met all objections with a firm and contemptuous smile
with the smile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of a case
again glancing round for support to Milorádovich who was near him
But even if he also took up a position in the Thuerassa
But was it really not possible for Kutúzov to state his views plainly to the Emperor
memories rose in his imagination: he remembered his last parting from his father and his wife; he remembered the days when he first loved her
He thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and for himself
and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he went out of the hut in which he was billeted with Nesvítski and began to walk up and down before it
did not answer that voice and went on dreaming of his triumphs
The dispositions for the next battle are planned by him alone
wife—those dearest to me—yet dreadful and unnatural as it seems
Rostóv was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front of Bagratión’s detachment
now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy ought to be
that the Emperor will meet me and give me an order as he would to any other officer; he’ll say: ‘Go and find out what’s there
And in order to realize vividly his love devotion to the sovereign
Rostóv pictured to himself an enemy or a deceitful German
I’ll take another turn and when I get back I’ll go to the general and ask him
and facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a wall
past whom Rostóv was riding in the act of falling asleep
and all along the French line on the hill fires flared up and the shouting grew louder and louder
Rostóv could hear the sound of French words but could not distinguish them
Rostóv’s horse was also getting restive: it pawed the frozen ground
pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights
The hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily
The sound of horse’s hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was heard
still looking round toward the fires and the shouts
and trotted downhill in the direction from which the shouting came
He felt both frightened and pleased to be riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty distance where no one had been before him
Bagratión called to him from the hill not to go beyond the stream
but Rostóv pretended not to hear him and did not stop but rode on and on
he no longer saw either our own or the enemy’s fires
but heard the shouting of the French more loudly and distinctly
Having come out onto the road he reined in his horse
hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it and ride over the black field up the hillside
Only when approaching Bagratión did Rostóv let his horse gallop again
and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general
The Russian army is advancing against you to avenge the Austrian army of Ulm
Do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded
This victory will conclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters
where fresh French troops who are being raised in France will join us
munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to warm themselves
and everything that they did not want or could not carry away with them
Austrian column guides were moving in and out among the Russian troops and served as heralds of the advance
As soon as an Austrian officer showed himself near a commanding officer’s quarters
The train drivers and orderlies harnessed and packed the wagons and tied on the loads
and commissions to the baggage men who remained behind
and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet resounded
to see either the place they were leaving or that to which they were going
The sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which his ship is sailing
but on the day of battle—heaven knows how and whence—a stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral atmosphere of an army
and eagerly ask concerning what is going on around them
The fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could not see ten paces ahead
other Russian columns were moving in the same direction
But when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog
the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks
the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid Germans
And the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to turn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the Germans
The cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry was moving toward our left flank
the higher command found that our center was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all ordered to turn back to the right
At the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide and a Russian general
and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through the ranks
and above all being unable to see anything in front or around them in the thick fog
the Russians exchanged shots with the enemy lazily and advanced and again halted
there was still thick fog; on the higher ground it was clearing
in the blue cloak which he had worn on his Italian campaign
sat on his small gray Arab horse a little in front of his marshals
He gazed silently at the hills which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the Russian troops were moving in the distance
and he listened to the sounds of firing in the valley
Part of the Russian force had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and part were leaving these Pratzen Heights which he intended to attack and regarded as the key to the position
were moving continuously in one direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into the mist
From information he had received the evening before
he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away in front of them
and that the columns moving near Pratzen constituted the center of the Russian army
and his cold face wore that special look of confident
self-complacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily in love
and a few minutes later the chief forces of the French army moved rapidly toward those Pratzen Heights which were being more and more denuded by Russian troops moving down the valley to their left
the one that was to take the place of Przebyszéwski’s and Langeron’s columns which had already gone down into the valley
He greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave them the order to march
thereby indicating that he intended to lead that column himself
among the immense number forming the commander in chief’s suite
He was in a state of suppressed excitement and irritation
though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of a long-awaited moment
I shall go forward and break whatever is in front of me
That may be the very standard with which I shall lead the army
In the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was a hoar frost now turning to dew
but in the valleys it still lay like a milk-white sea
An Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat galloped up to Kutúzov and asked in the Emperor’s name had the fourth column advanced into action
Kutúzov’s malevolent and caustic expression softened
Overtaking the battalions that continued to advance
he stopped the third division and convinced himself that there really were no sharpshooters in front of our columns
The colonel at the head of the regiment was much surprised at the commander in chief’s order to throw out skirmishers
He had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles away
There was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descent hidden by dense mist
Just then at a distance behind Kutúzov was heard the sound of regiments saluting
and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended line of the advancing Russian columns
Evidently the person they were greeting was riding quickly
When the soldiers of the regiment in front of which Kutúzov was standing began to shout
he rode a little to one side and looked round with a frown
One in a black uniform with white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse
the other who was in a white uniform rode a black one
His whole appearance and manner were suddenly transformed
He put on the air of a subordinate who obeys without reasoning
This unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face of the Emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished
After his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field of Olmütz where Bolkónski had seen him for the first time abroad
but there was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in his fine gray eyes
and on his delicate lips the same capacity for varying expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent youth
looking about him in a leisurely and preoccupied manner
watching his old acquaintance with a smile he could not repress as he recalled his reception at Brünn
Among them were grooms leading the Tsar’s beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered cloths
we are not on the Empress’ Field where a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled
said the Tsar with another glance at the Emperor Francis
as if inviting him if not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying
apparently to preclude the possibility of not being heard
This horse that had carried the sovereign at reviews in Russia bore him also here on the field of Austerlitz
CHAPTER XVI  Kutúzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the carabineers
Both of them led downhill and troops were marching along both
The expression on all their faces suddenly changed to one of horror
The French were supposed to be a mile and a half away
With the naked eye Prince Andrew saw below them to the right
not more than five hundred paces from where Kutúzov was standing
Confused and ever-increasing crowds were running back to where five minutes before the troops had passed the Emperors
Not only would it have been difficult to stop that crowd
was shouting to Kutúzov that if he did not ride away at once he would certainly be taken prisoner
A fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it
Another in the same place turned round and fired in the air; a third was striking the horse Kutúzov himself rode
neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the fleeing crowd
After this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg; several soldiers fell
He also saw French infantry soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns round
Prince Andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces of the cannon
He heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped
But he did not look at them: he looked only at what was going on in front of him—at the battery
He now saw clearly the figure of a red-haired gunner with his shako knocked awry
pulling one end of a mop while a French soldier tugged at the other
hoping to see how the struggle of the Frenchmen with the gunners ended
Prince Bagratión proposed to Dolgorúkov to send to inquire of the commander in chief
Bagratión knew that as the distance between the two flanks was more than six miles
even if the messenger were not killed (which he very likely would be)
On receiving the order he gave his horse the rein and galloped along the line
At first he rode along the line of Bagratión’s troops
but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before Pratzen
interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a general roar
make out moving masses of infantry and narrow lines of artillery with green caissons
Rostóv stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was going on
Rostóv put his horse to full gallop to get out of the way of these men
Rostóv could already see their faces and heard the command:  Charge
fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on the French
Rostóv hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where he was sent
This was the brilliant charge of the Horse Guards that amazed the French themselves
When he came level with the Foot Guards he noticed that about them and around them cannon balls were flying
of which he was aware not so much because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on the soldiers’ faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the officers
and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged by those troops that they were themselves in the front line and had unexpectedly to go into action
going far round the place where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard
and if all is lost it is for me to perish with the rest
The idea of defeat and flight could not enter Rostóv’s head
CHAPTER XVIII  Rostóv had been ordered to look for Kutúzov and the Emperor near the village of Pratzen
But neither they nor a single commanding officer were there
only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds
He urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds
but the farther he went the more disorganized they were
Rostóv stopped the horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to question him
Rostóv let go of the horse and was about to ride on
lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each couple of acres
who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and wounded where there was no one left to fire at
on seeing an adjutant riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots
if she saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimed at me
In the village of Hosjeradek there were Russian troops retiring from the field of battle
who though still in some confusion were less disordered
The French cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire sounded far away
Here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle was lost
No one whom Rostóv asked could tell him where the Emperor or Kutúzov was
and explained the false rumor that had spread by the fact that the Emperor’s carriage had really galloped from the field of battle with the pale and terrified Ober-Hofmarschal Count Tolstóy
who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in the Emperor’s suite
not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience
whose figure seemed familiar to Rostóv and involuntarily riveted his attention
and dares not utter the thoughts he has dreamed of for nights
It is as if I were glad of a chance to take advantage of his being alone and despondent
when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight of him
Not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the Emperor that he had composed in his imagination could he now recall
Those speeches were intended for quite other conditions
they were for the most part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph
generally when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds
and while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved
Better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind look or bad opinion from him
who still remained in the same attitude of indecision
sat down under an apple tree and von Toll remained beside him
Before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points
More than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the French
Przebyszéwski and his corps had laid down their arms
Other columns after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused masses
The remains of Langeron’s and Dokhtúrov’s mingled forces were crowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of Augesd
handled the floundering silvery fish in the watering can
on that dam over which for so many years Moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully driven their two-horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty with flour whitening their carts—on that narrow dam amid the wagons and the cannon
under the horses’ hoofs and between the wagon wheels
only to move on a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way
with the regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company
The general on horseback at the entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address Dólokhov
One of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the ice
Crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond
Toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still
He did not know how long his unconsciousness lasted
with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape
lay on his stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide
and having gone on a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew
who lay on his back with the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him
He knew it was Napoleon—his hero—but at that moment Napoleon seemed to him such a small
insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it
At that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him
or what was said of him; he was only glad that people were standing near him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to life
rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the victory
and the probing of his wound at the dressing station
He did not regain consciousness till late in the day
when with other wounded and captured Russian officers he was carried to the hospital
During this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look about him and even speak
The first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a French convoy officer
indicating a Russian officer in the white uniform of the Horse Guards
So insignificant at that moment seemed to him all the interests that engrossed Napoleon
Looking into Napoleon’s eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of greatness
the meaning of which no one alive could understand or explain
The soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brother’s neck
Prince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced
glancing at the icon his sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence
it would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to Mary
which I not only cannot address but which I cannot even express in words—the Great All or Nothing-  said he to himself
nothing at all except the unimportance of everything I understand
The quiet home life and peaceful happiness of Bald Hills presented itself to him
was left to the care of the inhabitants of the district
BOOK FOUR: 1806      CHAPTER I  Early in the year 1806 Nicholas Rostóv returned home on leave
Denísov was going home to Vorónezh and Rostóv persuaded him to travel with him as far as Moscow and to stay with him there
Meeting a comrade at the last post station but one before Moscow
Denísov had drunk three bottles of wine with him and
and there’s Zakhár himself and still the same horse
threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the large dark ballroom
something flew out from a side door like a tornado and began hugging and kissing him
sprang away and pranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly
A rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of girls’ voices came from the adjoining room
having found and seized the sabers in the outer room
with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother
They hardly gave one another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves
I just heated a ruler in the fire and pressed it there
Rostóv re-entered that world of home and childhood which had no meaning for anyone else
if you say that—if you consider yourself bound by your promise—it will seem as if she had not meant it seriously
Rostóv saw that it had been well considered by them
was looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave with her
looking just as smart as he made himself when going into battle
After a short period of adapting himself to the old conditions of life
his borrowing money from Gavríl to pay a sleigh driver
and respected racing men was training a trotter of his own for a race
and was on intimate terms with a colonel of forty to whom Denísov had introduced him
as he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him
he often spoke about him and about his love for him
letting it be understood that he had not told all and that there was something in his feelings for the Emperor not everyone could understand
many more such girls somewhere whom I do not yet know
it seemed to him that the society of women was rather derogatory to his manhood
old Count Ilyá Rostóv was very busy arranging a dinner in honor of Prince Bagratión at the English Club
The count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown
The count had been a member and on the committee of the club from the day it was founded
To him the club entrusted the arrangement of the festival in honor of Bagratión
and still fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out of their own resources what might be needed for the success of the fete
The club cook and the steward listened to the count’s orders with pleased faces
Though she came upon the count in his dressing gown every day
the Russians were so used to victories that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it
and the Moscovites who took their opinions from others—Ilyá Rostóv among them—remained for a while without any definite opinion on the subject of the war and without leaders
the bigwigs who guided the club’s opinion reappeared
distinguished by his Schön Grabern affair and by the retreat from Austerlitz
where he alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day beaten back an enemy force twice as numerous as his own
honor was shown to a simple fighting Russian soldier without connections and intrigues
All Moscow repeated Prince Dolgorúkov’s saying:  If you go on modeling and modeling you must get smeared with clay
suggesting consolation for our defeat by the memory of former victories; and the words of Rostopchín
that French soldiers have to be incited to battle by highfalutin words
and Germans by logical arguments to show them that it is more dangerous to run away than to advance
This class of guests and members sat in certain habitual places and met in certain habitual groups
who at his wife’s command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles
he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to his wealth
By his age he should have belonged to the younger men
Rostopchín was describing how the Russians had been overwhelmed by flying Austrians and had had to force their way through them with bayonets
whose acquaintance he had lately made and highly valued
and—like rye shaken together in a shovel—the guests who had been scattered about in different rooms came together and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of the ballroom
as when Rostóv had seen him on the eve of the battle of Austerlitz
He walked shyly and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room
not knowing what to do with his hands; he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed field under fire
went out of the drawing room and reappeared a minute later with another committeeman
carrying a large silver salver which he presented to Prince Bagratión
he resolutely took the salver with both hands and looked sternly and reproachfully at the count who had presented it to him
began to read them with a fixed and serious expression
But the author himself took the verses and began reading them aloud
He was seated in the place of honor between two Alexanders—Bekleshëv and Narýshkin—which was a significant allusion to the name of the sovereign
Three hundred persons took their seats in the dining room
according to their rank and importance: the more important nearer to the honored guest
a gigantic sterlet (at sight of which Ilyá Rostóv blushed with self-conscious pleasure)
and at the same moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm
in exactly the same voice in which he had shouted it on the field at Schön Grabern
the footmen cleared away the broken glass and everybody sat down again
He seemed to see and hear nothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by some depressing and unsolved problem
and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning
which in the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw badly through his spectacles
but that his wife’s connection with Dólokhov was a secret to no one but himself
Every time he chanced to meet Dólokhov’s handsome insolent eyes
Pierre felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul and turned quickly away
Involuntarily recalling his wife’s past and her relations with Dólokhov
Pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be true
Pierre recalled how Hélène had smilingly expressed disapproval of Dólokhov’s living at their house
He remembered the expression Dólokhov’s face assumed in his moments of cruelty
as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them into the water
one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious duelist and rake
who was distributing leaflets with Kutúzov’s cantata
Hearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed
At the very instant he did this and uttered those words
He looked about distractedly and screwed up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun
He was entirely absorbed by two considerations: his wife’s guilt
But just at moments when such thoughts occurred to him
He took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the trigger
in a small clearing in the pine forest covered with melting snow
the frost having begun to break up during the last few days
left tracks in the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and Nesvítski’s and Dólokhov’s sabers
which were stuck into the ground ten paces apart to mark the barrier
It was evident that the affair so lightly begun could no longer be averted but was taking its course independently of men’s will
missing the trodden path and stepping into the deep snow
because he wished to support his right hand with it and knew he must not do so
Rostóv and Denísov drove away with the wounded Dólokhov
CHAPTER VI  Pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone
Both in Petersburg and in Moscow their house was always full of visitors
but had to jump up and pace the room with rapid steps
In marrying her without loving her; in deceiving yourself and her
And he vividly recalled that moment after supper at Prince Vasíli’s
looked into his face and at his dressing gown and smiled slightly
How often when considering her character I have told myself that I was to blame for not understanding her
for not understanding that constant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desires
and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved woman
Now I have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become clear
One day I asked her if she felt any symptoms of pregnancy
She laughed contemptuously and said she was not a fool to want to have children
and that she was not going to have any children by me
Then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her
when one has only a moment of life in comparison with eternity
But at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections
she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had most strongly expressed his insincere love for her
He resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his intention to part from her forever
Next morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee
Pierre was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand
But before Pierre could decide what answer he would send
except that there was a wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow
With her imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in front of the valet
She knew of the duel and had come to speak about it
she said in French with her coarse plainness of speech
there was a weight on his chest and he could not breathe
in such a terrible voice that the whole house heard it with horror
God knows what he would have done at that moment had Hélène not fled from the room
CHAPTER VII  Two months had elapsed since the news of the battle of Austerlitz and the loss of Prince Andrew had reached Bald Hills
and in spite of the letters sent through the embassy and all the searches made
his body had not been found nor was he on the list of prisoners
alone among strangers and unable to send news of himself
that after brilliant engagements the Russians had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order
The old prince understood from this official report that our army had been defeated
To the great regret of myself and of the whole army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not
I comfort myself and you with the hope that your son is alive
for otherwise he would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field of battle
and though he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone
The princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father and wept
her downy lip rose and remained lifted in childlike happiness
looking firmly with her radiant eyes at her sister-in-law
Princess Mary and the old prince each bore and hid their grief in their own way
The old prince would not cherish any hope: he made up his mind that Prince Andrew had been killed
and though he sent an official to Austria to seek for traces of his son
and even every footstep in that house since the terrible news had come
And besides the pallor and the physical suffering on the little princess’ face
And the little princess began to cry capriciously like a suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some affectation
Princess Mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the house
now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching what was going on in the passage
who hardly ever came to that room as the old prince had forbidden it
Everyone in the house was dominated by the same feeling that Princess Mary experienced as she sat in her room
But owing to the superstition that the fewer the people who know of it the less a woman in travail suffers
everyone tried to pretend not to know; no one spoke of it
and Tíkhon did not hear the slightest sound from the study after that
and going up to him silently kissed him on the shoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he had entered
It was one of those March nights when winter seems to wish to resume its sway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury
A relay of horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the German doctor from Moscow who was expected every moment
and men on horseback with lanterns were sent to the crossroads to guide him over the country road with its hollows and snow-covered pools of water
Princess Mary had long since put aside her book: she sat silent
her luminous eyes fixed on her nurse’s wrinkled face (every line of which she knew so well)
Suddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement of the window
from which the double frame had been removed (by order of the prince
went to the window and leaning out tried to catch the open casement
Princess Mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet the newcomer
one could hear the footstep of someone in thick felt boots
in a fur cloak the deep collar of which covered with snow
and not waiting for a reply—which he would not have received
for the princess was unable to speak—he turned back
CHAPTER IX  The little princess lay supported by pillows
with a white cap on her head (the pains had just left her)
Strands of her black hair lay round her inflamed and perspiring cheeks
her charming rosy mouth with its downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully
but did not realize the significance of his appearance before her now
She was not surprised at his having come; she did not realize that he had come
His coming had nothing to do with her sufferings or with their relief
Prince Andrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the room next to hers
A woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and became confused when she saw Prince Andrew
Then suddenly a terrible shriek—it could not be hers
she could not scream like that—came from the bedroom
Then suddenly he realized the joyful significance of that wail; tears choked him
but the doctor gave him a bewildered look and passed by without a word
in the same position he had seen her in five minutes before and
despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of the cheeks
He looked up joyfully at the baby when the nurse brought it to him and nodded approval when she told him that the wax with the baby’s hair had not sunk in the font but had floated
CHAPTER X  Rostóv’s share in Dólokhov’s duel with Bezúkhov was hushed up by the efforts of the old count
and instead of being degraded to the ranks as he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of Moscow
As a result he could not go to the country with the rest of the family
and Rostóv became very friendly with him during his convalescence
loved him and even now never says a word against him
but I have not yet met any women—countesses or cooks—who were not venal
Nicholas brought many young men to his parents’ house
At that time in the Rostóvs’ house there prevailed an amorous atmosphere characteristic of homes where there are very young and very charming girls
Every young man who came to the house—seeing those impressionable
and hearing the fitful bursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of young girls ready for anything and full of hope—experienced the same feeling; sharing with the young folk of the Rostóvs’ household a readiness to fall in love and an expectation of happiness
never missed a performance at which they were present
and went to Iogel’s balls for young people which the Rostóvs always attended
He was pointedly attentive to Sónya and looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his glances without coloring
Rostóv noticed something new in Dólokhov’s relations with Sónya
But he was not as much at ease with Sónya and Dólokhov as before and was less frequently at home
Everywhere Bonaparte was anathematized and in Moscow nothing but the coming war was talked of
For the Rostóv family the whole interest of these preparations for war lay in the fact that Nicholas would not hear of remaining in Moscow
and only awaited the termination of Denísov’s furlough after Christmas to return with him to their regiment
As soon as he entered he noticed and felt the tension of the amorous air in the house
Nicholas understood that something must have happened between Sónya and Dólokhov before dinner
and with the kindly sensitiveness natural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner
and he was further confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that Dólokhov left immediately after dinner
Little as Nicholas had occupied himself with Sónya of late
something seemed to give way within him at this news
From the point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the question for her to refuse him
That’s capital; of course she’ll forget her childish promises and accept the offer
but I have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in love again
CHAPTER XII  Iogel’s were the most enjoyable balls in Moscow
So said the mothers as they watched their young people executing their newly learned steps
and so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced till they were ready to drop
The two pretty young Princesses Gorchakóv met suitors there and were married and so further increased the fame of these dances
What distinguished them from others was the absence of host or hostess and the presence of the good-natured Iogel
Sónya twirled about before she left home so that the maid could hardly get her hair plaited
and she was transparently radiant with impulsive joy
Natásha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a real ball was even happier
They were both dressed in white muslin with pink ribbons
Denísov did not take his eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearly indicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not because he could not
Knowing that Denísov had a reputation even in Poland for the masterly way in which he danced the mazurka
She saw that everybody was looking at her and waiting
Only on horse back and in the mazurka was Denísov’s short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow he felt himself to be
and flew round the room taking his partner with him
He glided silently on one foot half across the room
dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if he would rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath
smartly whirling his partner round in front of her chair
flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself with his handkerchief
sat down by Natásha and did not leave her for the rest of the evening
I am giving a farewell supper tonight to my friends—come to the English Hotel
Beneath his smile Rostóv saw in him the mood he had shown at the club dinner and at other times
Please place your money on the cards or I may get muddled in the reckoning
The game continued; a waiter kept handing round champagne
Much depended on Rostóv’s winning or losing on that seven of hearts
On the previous Sunday the old count had given his son two thousand rubles
Nicholas had replied that it would be more than enough for him and that he gave his word of honor not to take anything more till the spring
Now only twelve hundred rubles was left of that money
with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs
said Dólokhov with a side glance at Rostóv as he continued to deal
In reality it already exceeded twenty thousand rubles
Dólokhov was no longer listening to stories or telling them
but followed every movement of Rostóv’s hands and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him
He had decided to play until that score reached forty-three thousand
and at one moment prayed to God as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge over the Enns
and then guessed that the card that came first to hand from the crumpled heap under the table would save him
now counted the cords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the total of his losses on it
then he looked round for aid from the other players
put it aside and began rapidly adding up the total of Rostóv’s debt
Some swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold outside and saying something in their gypsy accents
Now a bullet through my brain—that’s all that’s left me
pointing to the figure twenty-one by which the total exceeded the round sum of forty-three thousand; and taking up a pack he prepared to deal
and felt that Dólokhov knew that he could save him from all this shame and sorrow
sat at the clavichord striking chords with his short fingers
At that moment she was oblivious of her surroundings
and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may produce at the same intervals and hold for the same time
painstaking effect that had been in it before; but she did not yet sing well
and how moved was something that was finest in Rostóv’s soul
CHAPTER XVI  It was long since Rostóv had felt such enjoyment from music as he did that day
But no sooner had Natásha finished her barcarolle than reality again presented itself
He got up without saying a word and went downstairs to his own room
while in his soul he regarded himself as a worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime
and Natásha ran across the drawing room to the dancing hall
All Denísov’s Moscow friends gave him a farewell entertainment at the gypsies’
It was as if she wanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made her love him all the more
to overtake his regiment which was already in Poland
He had begun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the same question—one so important that he took no notice of what went on around him
Not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to Petersburg earlier or later
or whether he secured accommodation at this station
Pierre looked at them over his spectacles unable to understand what they wanted or how they could go on living without having solved the problems that so absorbed him
he always returned to these same questions which he could not solve and yet could not cease to ask himself
he would let his excellency have the courier horses
because he needs money for food; the man said an officer had once given him a thrashing for letting a private traveler have the courier horses
and Louis XVI was executed because they considered him a criminal
I have hundreds of rubles I don’t know what to do with
As if that money could add a hair’s breadth to happiness or peace of mind
Can anything in the world make her or me less a prey to evil and death
He began reading about the sufferings and virtuous struggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld
Yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances Pierre found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction
evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown
and moved aside on the sofa by way of inviting the other to take a seat beside him
both the face and words of his new acquaintance were irresistibly attractive to Pierre
and wavering between the confidence the personality of the Freemason inspired in him and his own habit of ridiculing the Masonic beliefs— I am afraid I am very far from understanding—how am I to put it
Only by laying stone on stone with the cooperation of all
by the millions of generations from our forefather Adam to our own times
and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered
and turning the leaves of his book with his old hands which from excitement he could not keep still
but believing with his whole soul what the stranger said
in the speaker’s tone of conviction and earnestness
which radiated from his whole being (and which struck Pierre especially by contrast with his own dejection and hopelessness)—at any rate
Can I receive that pure liquid into an impure vessel and judge of its purity
The highest wisdom has but one science—the science of the whole—the science explaining the whole creation and man’s place in it
Look then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit
It seemed to him that he had been vicious only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to be virtuous
Not a trace of his former doubts remained in his soul
He firmly believed in the possibility of the brotherhood of men united in the aim of supporting one another in the path of virtue
and that is how Freemasonry presented itself to him
CHAPTER III  On reaching Petersburg Pierre did not let anyone know of his arrival
of believing in the possibility of attaining perfection
whom Pierre had known slightly in Petersburg society
A person of very high standing in our Brotherhood has made application for you to be received into our Order before the usual term and has proposed to me to be your sponsor
I consider it a sacred duty to fulfill that person’s wishes
To Pierre’s inquiries as to what he must do and how he should answer
Willarski only replied that brothers more worthy than he would test him and that Pierre had only to tell the truth
He experienced a variety of most complex sensations
He felt afraid of what would happen to him and still more afraid of showing his fear
He felt curious to know what was going to happen and what would be revealed to him; but most of all
only a small lamp was burning inside something white
and the white thing with the lamp inside was a human skull with its cavities and teeth
After reading the first words of the Gospel:  In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God
then moved with cautious steps toward the table and placed on it his small leather-gloved hands
This short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest and part of his legs; he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a high white ruffle
At the moment the door opened and the stranger came in
the foundation on which it rests and which no human power can destroy
even from the first man—a mystery on which perhaps the fate of mankind depends
offering it in our members an example of piety and virtue
and a mental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mind
the Rhetor returned to inform the seeker of the seven virtues
to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe
the meaning of which is only now gradually opening before me
(He now felt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will to those who knew the indubitable truth
He forgot what the seventh virtue was and could not recall it
that our Order delivers its teaching not in words only but also by other means
which may perhaps have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom and virtue than mere words
You will perhaps also see in your further initiation a like method of enlightenment
and left boot according to the Rhetor’s instructions
The Mason drew the shirt back from Pierre’s left breast
and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers to above the knee
Pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also and was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger the trouble
Pierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing source of blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion
to the accompaniment of various knockings with mallets and swords
As he was being led up to some object he noticed a hesitation and uncertainty among his conductors
and told him to hold a pair of compasses to his left breast with the other hand and to repeat after someone who read aloud an oath of fidelity to the laws of the Order
wearing aprons like the Rhetor’s and holding swords in their hands pointed at his breast
Then the candles were relit and he was told that he would see the full light; the bandage was again removed and more than ten voices said together:  Sic transit gloria mundi
Pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room and at the people in it
On his right sat the Italian abbé whom Pierre had met at Anna Pávlovna’s two years before
At one side of the table was a small carpet with various figures worked upon it
at the other was something resembling an altar on which lay a Testament and a skull
He told him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of that apron
which symbolized strength and purity; then of the unexplained trowel
he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from vice
he said that Pierre could not know their meaning but must keep them
Give them to the woman whom you shall honor most of all
that these gloves do not deck hands that are unclean
was not in a state to understand what was being read
not knowing how to answer the congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all sides
He acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men only brothers
and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of humility
The Grand Master proposed that the last duty should be performed
and had quite left behind his former habits and way of life
CHAPTER V  The day after he had been received into the Lodge
he had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the Emperor and that it would be wiser for him to leave Petersburg
He was so used to submitting to Prince Vasíli’s tone of careless self-assurance that he felt he would be unable to withstand it now
but he also felt that on what he said now his future depended—whether he would follow the same old road
or that new path so attractively shown him by the Masons
His new brethren gave him letters to the Kiev and Odessa Masons and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity
CHAPTER VI  The duel between Pierre and Dólokhov was hushed up and
in spite of the Emperor’s severity regarding duels at that time
Pierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was an illegitimate son
and petted and extolled when he was the best match in Russia
he was said to be insanely jealous and subject like his father to fits of bloodthirsty rage
And when after Pierre’s departure Hélène returned to Petersburg
she was received by all her acquaintances not only cordially
but even with a shade of deference due to her misfortune
When conversation turned on her husband Hélène assumed a dignified expression
which with characteristic tact she had acquired though she did not understand its significance
I said at the time and before anyone else  (she insisted on her priority)  that that senseless young man was spoiled by the depraved ideas of these days
I was against this marriage even then and foretold all that has happened
Anna Pávlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of soirees as before—such as she alone had the gift of arranging—at which was to be found  the cream of really good society
when all the sad details of Napoleon’s destruction of the Prussian army at Jena and Auerstädt and the surrender of most of the Prussian fortresses had been received
The novelty Anna Pávlovna was setting before her guests that evening was Borís Drubetskóy
who had just arrived as a special messenger from the Prussian army and was aide-de-camp to a very important personage
We shall not cease to express our sincere views on that subject
entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an aide-de-camp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and then brought back to the general circle
had been sent on a very important mission to Prussia
and had just returned from there as a special messenger
He had become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had been so pleased at Olmütz and according to which an ensign might rank incomparably higher than a general
but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can grant rewards
and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his success and at the inability of others to understand these things
but would spend his last groat to be better dressed than others
and would rather deprive himself of many pleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear in the streets of Petersburg in an old uniform
The remembrance of the Rostóvs’ house and of his childish love for Natásha was unpleasant to him and he had not once been to see the Rostóvs since the day of his departure for the army
He took the seat indicated to him beside the fair Hélène and listened to the general conversation
correct French many interesting details about the armies and the court
and Anna Pávlovna felt that the novelty she had served up was received with pleasure by all her visitors
The greatest attention of all to Borís’ narrative was shown by Hélène
She asked him several questions about his journey and seemed greatly interested in the state of the Prussian army
Borís promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a conversation with her
CHAPTER VII  When Borís and Anna Pávlovna returned to the others Prince Hippolyte had the ear of the company
The conversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the political news
It became particularly animated toward the end of the evening when the rewards bestowed by the Emperor were mentioned
Hélène who had spoken very little all the evening again turned to Borís
Borís received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to come
There were other guests and the countess talked little to him
and only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly and in a whisper
which had become particularly noticeable since the time when he thought his son had been killed
he did not think it right to refuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the Emperor himself
and this fresh opportunity for action gave him new energy and strength
and went into everything down to the minutest details himself
Princess Mary had ceased taking lessons in mathematics from her father
and when the old prince was at home went to his study with the wet nurse and little Prince Nicholas (as his grandfather called him)
The baby Prince Nicholas lived with his wet nurse and nurse Sávishna in the late princess’ rooms and Princess Mary spent most of the day in the nursery
and Princess Mary often deprived herself to give her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angel—as she called her nephew—and playing with him
Near the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over the tomb of the little princess
and in this chapel was a marble monument brought from Italy
representing an angel with outspread wings ready to fly upwards
The angel’s upper lip was slightly raised as though about to smile
though of this Prince Andrew said nothing to his sister
was that in the expression the sculptor had happened to give the angel’s face
Partly because of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills
After the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved not to continue his military service
and when the war recommenced and everybody had to serve
he took a post under his father in the recruitment so as to avoid active service
The coachman who had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters for Prince Andrew
evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion had prevailed
She drew her brother’s attention to the maid who was calling him in a whisper
mistrusting their household doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town
they had been trying first one remedy and then another
wrote in his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows:  Have just this moment received by special messenger very joyful news—if it’s not false
I can’t make out what the commander at Kórchevo—a certain Khandrikóv—is up to; till now the additional men and provisions have not arrived
Gallop off to him at once and say I’ll have his head off if everything is not here in a week
Have received another letter about the Preussisch-Eylau battle from Pétenka—he took part in it—and it’s all true
Mind you gallop off to Kórchevo without delay and carry out instructions
Prince Andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope
It was a closely written letter of two sheets from Bilíbin
He folded it up without reading it and reread his father’s letter
what he had too long been thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of all else
CHAPTER IX  Bilíbin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity
and though he wrote in French and used French jests and French idioms
he described the whole campaign with a fearless self-censure and self-derision genuinely Russian
Bilíbin wrote that the obligation of diplomatic discretion tormented him
having been written before the battle at Preussisch-Eylau
but it turns out that ‘the enemy of the human race’ pays no heed to our fine speeches and in his rude and savage way throws himself on the Prussians without giving them time to finish the parade they had begun
I am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant for us
as you yourself reported to Count Buxhöwden yesterday
quite prevents my riding and commanding so vast an army
with the information that if the army remains in its present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man left in it by spring
‘Grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is already in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and glorious task for which he was chosen
I shall await your most gracious permission here in hospital
that I may not have to play the part of a secretary rather than commander in the army
Those that follow are naturally increasingly interesting and entertaining
have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost
hoping to receive from Petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory
does not give up the command of the army to General Buxhöwden
but solely to avoid General Buxhöwden who by right of seniority should be our chief
and the result is a challenge on Buxhöwden’s part and an epileptic fit on Bennigsen’s
and in a way of which our last campaign can give you no idea
and the commander in chief has to ask for a battalion to disperse them
During one of these attacks they carried off my empty portmanteau and my dressing gown
The Emperor proposes to give all commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders
in spite of himself (although he knew how far it was safe to trust Bilíbin)
Suddenly he thought he heard a strange noise through the door
He was seized with alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he was reading the letter
He went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it
he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind him
As often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety
he was seized by an unreasoning panic—it occurred to him that the child was dead
sure that he would find it empty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby
At last he saw him: the rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across the bed with his head lower than the pillow
and was smacking his lips in his sleep and breathing evenly
gazing at his head and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket
taking with him full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to what he should do on his estates
When he reached Kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office and explained to them his intentions and wishes
He told them that steps would be taken immediately to free his serfs—and that till then they were not to be overburdened with labor
and schools were to be established on all the estates
Some of the stewards (there were semiliterate foremen among them) listened with alarm
supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased with their management and embezzlement of money
some after their first fright were amused by Pierre’s lisp and the new words they had not heard before
understood from this speech how they could best handle the master for their own ends
The chief steward expressed great sympathy with Pierre’s intentions
since he had come into an income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year
Pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him an allowance of ten thousand rubles
He had a dim perception of the following budget:  About 80
and the allowance to the three princesses; about 15
Besides this the chief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests
or of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops
So the first task Pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude or inclination—practical business
He discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward
But he felt that this did not forward matters at all
the chief steward put the state of things to him in the very worst light
Pierre demanded that steps should be taken to liberate the serfs
which the steward met by showing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the Land Bank
Pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it
Of the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre realized that he did not fulfill the one which enjoined every Mason to set an example of moral life
and that of the seven virtues he lacked two—morality and the love of death
In the spring of 1807 he decided to return to Petersburg
Continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs as impracticable
and asylums—on all the estates before the master arrived
which though they embarrassed Pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the depth of his heart
as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them
according to which the serfs’ manorial labor had been diminished
and heard the touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their full-skirted blue coats
and that the richest peasants (who formed the deputation) had begun the chantry long before
but that nine tenths of the peasants in that villages were in a state of the greatest poverty
He did not know that the priest who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions
He did not know that where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs’ payments had been diminished by a third
their obligatory manorial work had been increased by a half
And so Pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left Petersburg
a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly through the naïve and intelligent count and played with him as with a toy
seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on Pierre
Pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be difficult to imagine happier people
The steward promised to do all in his power to carry out the count’s wishes
seeing clearly that not only would the count never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken for the sale of the land and forests and to release them from the Land Bank
CHAPTER XI  Returning from his journey through South Russia in the happiest state of mind
The house lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and with banks still bare of grass
Pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in Petersburg
and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed back
His words were kindly and there was a smile on his lips and face
but what amazed and estranged Pierre till he got used to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged concentration on some one thought
As is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation
it was long before their conversation could settle on anything
They put questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to be talked over at length
The preoccupation and despondency which Pierre had noticed in his friend’s look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to Pierre
especially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past or the future
tell me about your travels and all you have been doing on your estates
Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates
trying as far as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been made
and he listened not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was telling him
who evidently also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor
talking of the political news and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other intimately
or at least trying  (Pierre’s modesty made him correct himself)  to live for others
What error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good
you want to raise him  (pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking off his cap)  from his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs
Others are being born and there are plenty of them as it is
Prince Andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was evident he had reflected on this subject more than once
and he spoke readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time
so I must live out my life as best I can without hurting others
but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the honor to choose me to be their marshal; it was all I could do to get out of it
I have promised myself not to serve again in the active Russian army
My father is chief in command of the Third District
and though not exactly cruel he has too energetic a character
He is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is terrible
So I am serving because I alone have any influence with my father
in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk who had stolen some boots from the recruits; I should even have been very glad to see him hanged
but cannot restrain themselves and grow more and more miserable
And he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince Andrew
and by the peculiar glow that came into Prince Andrew’s eyes and by his silence
Pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that Prince Andrew would not interrupt him or laugh at what he said
They reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to cross by ferry
the more readily as he knew Prince Andrew’s former atheistic convictions
and we who are now the children of earth are—eternally—children of the whole universe
but that I shall always exist and always have existed
All I say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the necessity of a future life
Prince Andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to Pierre
The raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the current beat softly against it below
he looked up at the sky to which Pierre had pointed
and for the first time since Austerlitz saw that high
It vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions of his life
but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to develop existed within him
His meeting with Pierre formed an epoch in Prince Andrew’s life
and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back soon
lowering her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers
Go to Kolyázin where a wonder-working icon of the Holy Mother of God has been revealed
and the people say to me: ‘A great blessing has been revealed
Such a brightness on the face like the light of heaven
She evidently felt frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a house where such things could be said
but in Pierre’s face there was such a look of sincere penitence
who led so holy a life that his hands smelled of incense
I understand them so well and have the greatest respect for them
Toward ten o’clock the men servants rushed to the front door
hearing the bells of the old prince’s carriage approaching
was looking over the papers his father had brought from town
Another says clever things and one doesn’t care to listen
did Pierre fully realize the strength and charm of his friendship with Prince Andrew
but even the one-year-old  Prince Nicholas  (as his grandfather called him) smiled at Pierre and let himself be taken in his arms
and Michael Ivánovich and Mademoiselle Bourienne looked at him with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince
The old prince came in to supper; this was evidently on Pierre’s account
And during the two days of the young man’s visit he was extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again
When Pierre had gone and the members of the household met together
Rostóv felt as he had done when approaching his home in Moscow
When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform of his regiment
ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him
and the officers collected round to greet the new arrival
and as unalterably dear and precious as his parents’ house
But here was none of all that turmoil of the world at large
to have an explanation; here was no possibility of going there or not going there; here there were not twenty-four hours in the day which could be spent in such a variety of ways; there was not that innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him or farther from him than another; there were none of those uncertain and undefined money relations with his father
Having once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental life
and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the campaign
It had been neither at Pultúsk nor at Preussisch-Eylau and
Plátov’s division was acting independently of the main army
and once had even captured Marshal Oudinot’s carriages
Everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fled—if any remained
The Pávlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action
the soldiers of Denísov’s squadron fed chiefly on  Máshka’s sweet root
because it was the second week that the last of the biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen
The horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched roofs and had become terribly thin
the soldiers and officers went on living just as usual
brought in straw from the thatched roofs in place of fodder
but by the tender friendship his commander showed him
Rostóv felt that the elder hussar’s luckless love for Natásha played a part in strengthening their friendship
Denísov evidently tried to expose Rostóv to danger as seldom as possible
in a deserted and ruined village to which he had come in search of provisions
CHAPTER XVI  In April the troops were enlivened by news of the Emperor’s arrival
but Rostóv had no chance of being present at the review he held at Bartenstein
embers from the soldiers’ campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the  reception room —as Denísov called that part of the hut—and it was then so warm that the officers
who had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk
and oxen he had seen when he had gone out for provisions
and Rostóv heard the hoofs of several horses splashing through the mud
and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playing sváyka
the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horses behind them
The wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an infantry regiment
The next day the regimental commander sent for Denísov
and holding his fingers spread out before his eyes said:   This is how I look at this affair: I know nothing about it and won’t begin proceedings
Denísov rode straight to the staff with a sincere desire to act on this advice
But at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into Rostóv’s and Denísov’s dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed them a paper addressed to Major Denísov from the regimental commander in which inquiries were made about yesterday’s occurrence
The adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn: that a court-martial had been appointed
and that in view of the severity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded
Denísov was ordered to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before the staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat office
A bullet fired by a French sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg
Perhaps at another time Denísov would not have left the regiment for so slight a wound
but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing at the staff and went into hospital
having no news of him since he left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his affairs
took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit Denísov in hospital
were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the yard
Directly Rostóv entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of putrefaction and hospital air
I am alone in charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients
Rostóv and the assistant went into the dark corridor
brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows
Most of them were unconscious and paid no attention to the newcomers
Those who were conscious raised themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces
He was knocking the back of his head against the floor
with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on Rostóv
who noticed that the old man wanted to speak to him
His pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were rolled back
There were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or sitting on them
Some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing gowns
The first person Rostóv met in the officers’ ward was a thin little man with one arm
still aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in the soldiers’ ward
and still seeming to see fixed on him those envious looks which had followed him out from both sides
and the face of that young soldier with eyes rolled back
and when Rostóv spoke of these matters did not listen
Rostóv even noticed that Denísov did not like to be reminded of the regiment
or in general of that other free life which was going on outside the hospital
he at once produced from under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the rough draft of his answer to it
who had gathered round Rostóv—a fresh arrival from the world outside—gradually began to disperse as soon as Denísov began reading his answer
in a voice to which he tried hard to give the old energy and fire
and you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it
though he instinctively felt that the way advised by Túshin and the other officers was the safest
and though he would have been glad to be of service to Denísov
coming from the window and giving Rostóv a large envelope
CHAPTER XIX  Having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of Denísov’s affairs
Rostóv rode to Tilsit with the letter to the Emperor
On the thirteenth of June the French and Russian Emperors arrived in Tilsit
Borís Drubetskóy had asked the important personage on whom he was in attendance
saw Napoleon pass before the French Guards on the farther bank of the river
Since he had begun to move in the highest circles Borís had made it his habit to watch attentively all that went on around him and to note it down
At the time of the meeting at Tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with Napoleon and about the uniforms they wore
and listened attentively to words spoken by important personages
At the moment the Emperors went into the pavilion he looked at his watch
and did not forget to look at it again when Alexander came out
but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted him
Count Zhilínski arranged a supper for his French friends
The guest of honor was an aide-de-camp of Napoleon’s
profiting by the darkness to avoid being recognized in civilian dress
happening to meet a wounded French colonel on the road
Rostóv had maintained with heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal Bonaparte
Rostóv was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of French officers in Borís’ lodging
that warlike feeling of hostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him
The look of annoyance had already disappeared from Borís’ face: having evidently reflected and decided how to act
Zhilínski evidently did not receive this new Russian person very willingly into his circle and did not speak to Rostóv
Borís did not appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and
for he alone took no part in the conversation which again became general
with one leg crossed over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender fingers of his right
listened to Rostóv as a general listens to the report of a subordinate
now looking aside and now gazing straight into Rostóv’s eyes with the same veiled look
Each time this happened Rostóv felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes
I have heard of such cases and know that His Majesty is very severe in such affairs
hearing the lighthearted French conversation from the next room
CHAPTER XX  Rostóv had come to Tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on Denísov’s behalf
staring at the French and their uniforms and at the streets and houses where the Russian and French Emperors were staying
In the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed
who had unconsciously returned to the house where Alexander lodged
I’ll go in and hand the letter to the Emperor myself so much the worse for Drubetskóy who drives me to it
And suddenly with a determination he himself did not expect
Rostóv grew frightened at what he was doing; the thought of meeting the Emperor at any moment was so fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away
and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed him
his heart sinking at the thought of finding himself at any moment face to face with the Emperor and being put to shame and arrested in his presence
It was a cavalry general who had obtained the Emperor’s special favor during this campaign
Hardly had Rostóv handed him the letter and finished explaining Denísov’s case
And the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign rose again in Rostóv’s soul in all its old force
All the suite drew back and Rostóv saw the general talking for some time to the Emperor
The Emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse
the Emperor turned to the cavalry general and said in a loud voice
and both Emperors dismounted and took each other’s hands
Rostóv kept his eyes on every movement of Alexander and Bonaparte
It struck him as a surprise that Alexander treated Bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with the Tsar
approached the right flank of the Preobrazhénsk battalion and came straight up to the crowd standing there
as with a composure and assurance exasperating to Rostóv
he ran his eyes over the Russian ranks drawn up before him
moved about and whispered as they passed something from one to another
and a page—the same one Rostóv had seen the previous evening at Borís’—ran forward and
pressed two fingers together and the badge was between them
Then he approached Lázarev (who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarch)
looked round at the Emperor Alexander to imply that what he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally
and the small white hand holding the Order touched one of Lázarev’s buttons
immediately seized the cross and fastened it to the uniform
Crowds of officers and civilians drew near merely to see him
with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease
Then again he thought of Lázarev rewarded and Denísov punished and unpardoned
He caught himself harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened
were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of Friedland
They said that had we held out a little longer Napoleon would have been done for
as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition
banging the table—very little to the point as it seemed to his listeners
In 1808 the Emperor Alexander went to Erfurt for a fresh interview with the Emperor Napoleon
and in the upper circles of Petersburg there was much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting
was such that when Napoleon declared war on Austria a Russian corps crossed the frontier to co-operate with our old enemy Bonaparte against our old ally the Emperor of Austria
independently of and apart from political friendship or enmity with Napoleon Bonaparte and from all the schemes of reconstruction
BOOK SIX: 1808 - 10      CHAPTER I  Prince Andrew had spent two years continuously in the country
All the plans Pierre had attempted on his estates—and constantly changing from one thing to another had never accomplished—were carried out by Prince Andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty
He had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which Pierre lacked
and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going
On one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became free agricultural laborers—this being one of the first examples of the kind in Russia
On other estates the serfs’ compulsory labor was commuted for a quitrent
A trained midwife was engaged for Boguchárovo at his expense
and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to the children of the peasants and household serfs
these people lagged behind himself—who never left the country—in knowledge of what was happening in home and foreign affairs
Besides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of books
Prince Andrew was at this time busy with a critical survey of our last two unfortunate campaigns
and with drawing up a proposal for a reform of the army rules and regulations
but looked absent-mindedly and cheerfully from side to side
uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain
past strips of stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there
The birches with their sticky green leaves were motionless
and lilac-colored flowers and the first blades of green grass were pushing up and lifting last year’s leaves
The coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there among the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter
On entering the forest the horses began to snort and sweated visibly
Peter the footman made some remark to the coachman; the latter assented
Probably ten times the age of the birches that formed the forest
and evidently long ago some of its branches had been broken off and its bark scarred
sticking out my broken and barked fingers just where they have grown
considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion
depressed and preoccupied with the business about which he had to speak to the Marshal
was driving up the avenue in the grounds of the Rostóvs’ house at Otrádnoe
He heard merry girlish cries behind some trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to cross the path of his calèche
Prince Andrew asked himself with instinctive curiosity
He was cross with the stupid old man (as he called Rostóv)
bushy vegetation with silver-lit leaves and stems here and there
Farther back beyond the dark trees a roof glittered with dew
thought Prince Andrew while he listened to her voice
It was already the beginning of June when on his return journey he drove into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and memorable an impression on him
stood rapt and slightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun
and all at once he was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal
Prince Andrew suddenly decided finally and decisively
It is not enough for me to know what I have in me—everyone must know it: Pierre
On reaching home Prince Andrew decided to go to Petersburg that autumn and found all sorts of reasons for this decision
He could not now understand how he could ever even have doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life
just as a month before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country could ever enter his head
on the strength of similar wretched logical arguments
After that journey to Ryazán he found the country dull; his former pursuits no longer interested him
Then he would turn away to the portrait of his dead Lise
who with hair curled à la grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame
as if punishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that stirred within him
At such moments Princess Mary would think how intellectual work dries men up
It was the time when the youthful Speránski was at the zenith of his fame and his reforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy
At that time the two famous decrees were being prepared that so agitated society—abolishing court ranks and introducing examinations to qualify for the grades of Collegiate Assessor and State Councilor—and not merely these but a whole state constitution
from the Council of State down to the district tribunals
Now those vague liberal dreams with which the Emperor Alexander had ascended the throne
and Strógonov—whom he himself in jest had called his Comité de salut public—were taking shape and being realized
The courtiers explained the Emperor’s neglect of him by His Majesty’s displeasure at Bolkónski’s not having served since 1805
Prince Andrew had seen the anterooms of many important men
and the different types of such rooms were well known to him
Count Arakchéev’s anteroom had quite a special character
The faces of the unimportant people awaiting their turn for an audience showed embarrassment and servility; the faces of those of higher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness
evidently feeling offended at having to wait so long
sat crossing and uncrossing his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself
But the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all faces—that of fear
Prince Andrew for the second time asked the adjutant on duty to take in his name
but received an ironical look and was told that his turn would come in due course
After some others had been shown in and out of the minister’s room by the adjutant on duty
Then suddenly the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard from the other side of the door
scowling brows above dull greenish-hazel eyes and an overhanging red nose
CHAPTER V  While waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee Prince Andrew looked up his former acquaintances
particularly those he knew to be in power and whose aid he might need
In Petersburg he now experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle
here in Petersburg a vast civil conflict was in preparation
the commander in chief of which was a mysterious person he did not know
but who was supposed to be a man of genius—Speránski
began to interest him so keenly that the question of the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his consciousness
Prince Andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the highest and most diverse Petersburg circles of the day
The reforming party cordially welcomed and courted him
in the first place because he was reputed to be clever and very well read
with a halo of romance on account of his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife
Prince Andrew spent the evening at Count Kochubéy’s
Speránski’s whole figure was of a peculiar type that made him easily recognizable
reporter to the Emperor and his companion at Erfurt
where he had more than once met and talked with Napoleon
and he looked only at the person with whom he was conversing
especially to men who judge those near to them severely
he knew by reputation—expected to discover in him the perfection of human qualities
and the old man who had talked about his subordinate Pryánichnikov addressed a question to him
held in his hands—those plump white hands—the fate of Russia
Prince Andrew was struck by the extraordinarily disdainful composure with which Speránski answered the old man
Speránski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign
Having talked for a little while in the general circle
Speránski rose and coming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other end of the room
he felt a difficulty in expressing himself now while talking with Speránski
and his idea that le principe des monarchies est l’honneur me paraît incontestable
Certains droits et privilèges de la noblesse me paraissent être des moyens de soutenir ce sentiment
The principle of monarchies is honor seems to me      incontestable
is one similar to the Légion d’honneur of the great Emperor Napoleon
Every courtier considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily
indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably an argument which was embarrassing for his companion
CHAPTER VI  During the first weeks of his stay in Petersburg Prince Andrew felt the whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city
He sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same remark on the same day in different circles
But he was so busy for whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking of nothing
As he had done on their first meeting at Kochubéy’s
Speránski produced a strong impression on Prince Andrew on the Wednesday
when he received him tête-à-tête at his own house and talked to him long and confidentially
To Bolkónski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant creatures
and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of that perfection toward which he strove
that he readily believed that in Speránski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous man
either because he appreciated the other’s capacity or because he considered it necessary to win him to his side
showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness before Prince Andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which goes hand in hand with self-assurance and consists in a tacit assumption that one’s companion is the only man besides oneself capable of understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the reasonableness and profundity of one’s own ideas
During their long conversation on Wednesday evening
clear-thinking man of vast intellect who by his energy and persistence had attained power
which he was using solely for the welfare of Russia
and was capable of applying the standard of reason to everything
it was only because he wished to maintain his independence and not submit to Speránski’s opinions entirely
which Prince Andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of those who possess power
by the excessive contempt for others that he observed in Speránski
Now he would take up the position of a practical man and condemn dreamers; now that of a satirist
(This last resource was one he very frequently employed
would again descend to the level of the original discussion
In general the trait of Speránski’s mentality which struck Prince Andrew most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and authority of reason
And it was just this peculiarity of Speránski’s mind that particularly attracted Prince Andrew
During the first period of their acquaintance Bolkónski felt a passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for Bonaparte
The fact that Speránski was the son of a village priest
and that stupid people might meanly despise him on account of his humble origin (as in fact many did)
having mentioned the Commission for the Revision of the Code of Laws
and had done nothing except that Rosenkampf had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codes
It is a vicious circle from which we must break a way out
A week later Prince Andrew was a member of the Committee on Army Regulations and—what he had not at all expected—was chairman of a section of the committee for the revision of the laws
At Speránski’s request he took the first part of the Civil Code that was being drawn up and
with the aid of the Code Napoléon and the Institutes of Justinian
and busied himself uniting various lodges and acquiring authentic charters
He gave money for the erection of temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms
in regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular
and though he considered it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of the bachelor circles in which he moved
Pierre at the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest upon it
the more Masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him
At the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the closer bound he involuntarily became to the order
All the members of the lodges were men Pierre knew in ordinary life
whom he knew in society mostly as weak and insignificant men
Pierre remembered the Masonic vow in which each Brother promised to devote all his belongings to his neighbor
and doubts on which he tried not to dwell arose in his soul
He divided the Brothers he knew into four categories
In the first he put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges or in human affairs
and salt—or the meaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple of Solomon
His heart was not in the mystical aspect of Freemasonry
In the third category he included those Brothers (the majority) who saw nothing in Freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies
and prized the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their purport or significance
but suspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated from its original principles
And so toward the end of the year he went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order
In the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg
and it seemed to them all that he was preparing something for them and concealing it
A solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened
and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by unity of purpose and possessed of authority and power
The whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of preparing men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of conviction—aiming at the punishment of vice and folly
and patronizing talent and virtue: raising worthy men from the dust and attaching them to our Brotherhood
we must found a form of government holding universal sway
which should be diffused over the whole world without destroying the bonds of citizenship
and beside which all other governments can continue in their customary course and do everything except what impedes the great aim of our order
should find in virtue a charm palpable to those senses
It is impossible to eradicate the passions; but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim
As soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state
and Pierre began developing his views with more and more warmth
At that meeting he was struck for the first time by the endless variety of men’s minds
which prevents a truth from ever presenting itself identically to two persons
Even those members who seemed to be on his side understood him in their own way with limitations and alterations he could not agree to
as what he always wanted most was to convey his thought to others just as he himself understood it
The Illuminati sought to substitute republican for      monarchical institutions
At the end of the meeting the Grand Master with irony and ill-will reproved Bezúkhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue alone
but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute
and without waiting for the usual formalities he left the lodge and went home
CHAPTER VIII  Again Pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded
For three days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at home receiving no one and going nowhere
telling him how grieved she was about him and how she wished to devote her whole life to him
At the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she would return to Petersburg from abroad
Following this letter one of the Masonic Brothers whom Pierre respected less than the others forced his way in to see him and
turning the conversation upon Pierre’s matrimonial affairs
sent to him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most important matter
and under the influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife
If he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife
was it not a matter of indifference whether he lived with his wife or not
Without replying either to his wife or his mother-in-law
Joseph Alexéevich is living poorly and has for three years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder
He received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed on which he lay
which at once lit up for me my whole past and the future path I should follow
He surprised me by asking whether I remembered the threefold aim of the order: (1) The preservation and study of the mystery
(2) The purification and reformation of oneself for its reception
Only to this aim can we always strive independently of circumstances
we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our impurity we are unworthy to receive
just because it is attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride
and (3) The attainment of the chief virtue—love of death
Joseph Alexéevich is never weary of life though he loves death
for which—in spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner man—he does not yet feel himself sufficiently prepared
My benefactor then explained to me fully the meaning of the Great Square of creation and pointed out to me that the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything
He advised me not to avoid intercourse with the Petersburg Brothers
to turn them toward the true path self-knowledge and self-perfecting
I knew that if I once let myself see her I should not have strength to go on refusing what she wanted
In my perplexity I did not know whose aid and advice to seek
Had my benefactor been here he would have told me what to do
I went to my room and reread Joseph Alexéevich’s letters and recalled my conversations with him
and deduced from it all that I ought not to refuse a supplicant
She need not know how hard it was for me to see her again
She was visited by the members of the French embassy and by many belonging to that circle and noted for their intellect and polished manners
Napoleon himself had noticed her in the theater and said of her:  C’est un superbe animal
(2) The distinguished Prince de Ligne wrote her eight-page letters
Bilíbin saved up his epigrams to produce them in Countess Bezúkhova’s presence
To be received in the Countess Bezúkhova’s salon was regarded as a diploma of intellect
At these parties his feelings were like those of a conjuror who always expects his trick to be found out at any moment
But whether because stupidity was just what was needed to run such a salon
or because those who were deceived found pleasure in the deception
which cannot be acquired artificially and therefore inspires involuntary respect
Sometimes he joined in a conversation which interested him and
which were sometimes not at all in accord with the accepted tone of the moment
But the general opinion concerning the queer husband of  the most distinguished woman in Petersburg  was so well established that no one took his freaks seriously
who had already achieved great success in the service
was the most intimate friend of the Bezúkhov household since Hélène’s return from Erfurt
In the eyes of the world Pierre was a great gentleman
the rather blind and absurd husband of a distinguished wife
But a complex and difficult process of internal development was taking place all this time in Pierre’s soul
(By Joseph Alexéevich’s advice Pierre had entered the service of the state and served on one of the committees
Returned home for dinner and dined alone—the countess had many visitors I do not like
I ate and drank moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the Brothers
A strange feeling agitated me all the time I was alone with him in the dark chamber
I caught myself harboring a feeling of hatred toward him which I vainly tried to overcome
It seemed to me that his object in entering the Brotherhood was merely to be intimate and in favor with members of our lodge
and all the time I stood alone with him in the dark temple it seemed to me that he was smiling contemptuously at my words
Now I recalled every detail of that meeting and in my mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter replies
I set myself above him and so become much worse than he
standing on the fence and pointing me to a broad avenue and garden
help me to tear from myself these dogs—my passions especially the last
which unites in itself the strength of all the former ones
and aid me to enter that temple of virtue to a vision of which I attained in my dream
7th December  I dreamed that Joseph Alexéevich was sitting in my house
and that I was very glad and wished to entertain him
But as soon as I drew near I saw that his face had changed and grown young
and then we suddenly found ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed
He shook his head incredulously; and even more abashed
And I awoke and found in my mind the text from the Gospel:  The life was the light of men
And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not
Joseph Alexéevich’s face had looked young and bright
That day I received a letter from my benefactor in which he wrote about  conjugal duties
and Joseph Alexéevich came in from the drawing room
And in my dream I knew that these drawings represented the love adventures of the soul with its beloved
And I seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a representation of the Song of Songs
I shall perish of my debauchery if Thou utterly desertest me
CHAPTER XI  The Rostóvs’ monetary affairs had not improved during the two years they had spent in the country
the way of life at Otrádnoe—Mítenka’s management of affairs
in particular—was such that the debts inevitably increased every year
The only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to apply for an official post
to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last time
Soon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to Véra and was accepted
Though in Moscow the Rostóvs belonged to the best society without themselves giving it a thought
and the son of their district postmaster who had obtained a post in Petersburg
Among the men who very soon became frequent visitors at the Rostóvs’ house in Petersburg were Borís
Pierre whom the count had met in the street and dragged home with him
the attentions a young man pays when he intends to propose
Not in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at Austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left
In the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself
he related this occurrence at such length and so insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do this
and held some special lucrative posts in Petersburg
Though some skeptics smiled when told of Berg’s merits
meeting a German comrade in the stalls of a Moscow theater
Berg’s proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not flattering to him
At first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure Livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a Countess Rostóva; but Berg’s chief characteristic was such a naïve and good natured egotism that the Rostóvs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing
my papa and mamma are now provided for—I have arranged that rent for them in the Baltic Provinces—and I can live in Petersburg on my pay
and with her fortune and my good management we can get along nicely
After the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by Berg’s proposal
In the family’s feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness and constraint was evident
an estate with three hundred serfs; but one of these estates had already been sold
At one time the count thought of giving her the Ryazán estate or of selling a forest
at another time of borrowing money on a note of hand
respectfully asked his future father-in-law to let him know what Véra’s dowry would be
who wished to be generous and to avoid further importunity
CHAPTER XII  Natásha was sixteen and it was the year 1809
she spoke quite freely of that episode as of some childish
long-forgotten matter that was not worth mentioning
Sometimes it occurred to Natásha that he did not wish to see her
and always spoke rapturously and gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on which he had entered
The memory of Natásha was his most poetic recollection
But he went with the firm intention of letting her and her parents feel that the childish relations between himself and Natásha could not be binding either on her or on him
He had a brilliant position in society thanks to his intimacy with Countess Bezúkhova
a brilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage of an important personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed
When he entered the Rostóvs’ drawing room Natásha was in her own room
without joining in Borís’ conversation with the countess
silently and minutely studied her childhood’s suitor
He sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess
arranging with his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left hand like a skin
and he spoke with a particularly refined compression of his lips about the amusements of the highest Petersburg society
but despite that resolution he called again a few days later and began calling often and spending whole days at the Rostóvs’
He left off visiting Hélène and received reproachful notes from her every day
and with her poor little knob of hair showing under her white cotton cap
The countess—her prayerful mood dispelled—looked round and frowned
and unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself
As she said this the countess looked round at her daughter
Natásha was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead
so that the countess only saw her daughter’s face in profile
Not everyone will understand this friendship dating from your childish days
and before Dunyásha had left the room had already passed into yet another happier world of dreams
1809 - 10 an old grandee of Catherine’s day was giving a ball and midnight supper
The diplomatic corps and the Emperor himself were to be present
The grandee’s well-known mansion on the English Quay glittered with innumerable lights
Police were stationed at the brightly lit entrance which was carpeted with red baize
and not only gendarmes but dozens of police officers and even the police master himself stood at the porch
Carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving
while ladies in satin and ermine cautiously descended the carriage steps which were let down for them with a clatter
and then walked hurriedly and noiselessly over the baize at the entrance
a thin and shallow maid of honor at the court of the Dowager Empress
She had got up at eight that morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day
Sónya and her mother put themselves entirely in her hands
as befits a ball; the openwork silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on; the hairdressing was almost done
She was still sitting before a looking-glass with a dressing jacket thrown over her slender shoulders
Sónya stood ready dressed in the middle of the room and
pressing the head of a pin till it hurt her dainty finger
They had decided to be at the ball by half-past ten
Two maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of thread
A third with pins in her mouth was running about between the countess and Sónya
In spite of her age and plainness she had gone through the same process as the Rostóvs
they settled themselves in their carriages and drove off
CHAPTER XV  Natásha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not once had time to think of what lay before her
In the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage
The prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true
mounted the brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers
Only then did she remember how she must behave at a ball
and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying with all her might to conceal it
And this was the very attitude that became her best
with diamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms
but the hostess’ eye involuntarily rested longer on the slim Natásha
irrecoverable days of her own girlhood and her own first ball
In the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting the Emperor
The countess took up a position in one of the front rows of that crowd
indicating an old man with a profusion of silver-gray curly hair
He had promised to be at the ball and introduce partners to her
who stood by a window talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon
bowing to right and left as if anxious to get the first moments of the reception over
and several persons with excited faces hurried there and back again
Then the crowd hastily retired from the drawing room door
and the Emperor came smiling out of the drawing room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the music
She and the countess and Sónya were standing by themselves as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers
who was telling her something about her own green dress
At last the Emperor stopped beside his last partner (he had danced with three) and the music ceased
A worried aide-de-camp ran up to the Rostóvs requesting them to stand farther back
went up to Countess Bezúkhova and asked her to dance
while at every third beat his partner’s velvet dress spread out and seemed to flash as she whirled round
stood looking animated and bright in the front row of the circle not far from the Rostóvs
he was gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who had not yet gathered courage to enter the circle
Prince Andrew was watching these men abashed by the Emperor’s presence
we will finish this conversation elsewhere—at a ball one must dance
said Prince Andrew with a low and courteous bow quite belying Perónskaya’s remarks about his rudeness
Prince Andrew was one of the best dancers of his day and Natásha danced exquisitely
hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had scanned her person
while Natásha was like a girl exposed for the first time
and wishing to escape as quickly as possible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed to him
and had chosen Natásha because Pierre pointed her out to him and because she was the first pretty girl who caught his eye; but scarcely had he embraced that slender supple figure and felt her stirring so close to him and smiling so near him than the wine of her charm rose to his head
She noticed and saw nothing of what occupied everyone else
Not only did she fail to notice that the Emperor talked a long time with the French ambassador
and how particularly gracious he was to a certain lady
or that Prince So-and-so and So-and-so did and said this and that
and only noticed that he had gone because the ball became livelier after his departure
For one of the merry cotillions before supper Prince Andrew was again her partner
He reminded her of their first encounter in the Otrádnoe avenue
and how she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night
and told her how he had involuntarily overheard her
Natásha blushed at that recollection and tried to excuse herself
With her he behaved with special care and tenderness
was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her
She was tired and panting and evidently thought of declining
When her partner left her Natásha ran across the room to choose two ladies for the figure
and asked his daughter whether she was enjoying herself
and Prince Andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her father and instantly dropped again
Natásha was happier than she had ever been in her life
loving one another; none of them capable of injuring another—and so they ought all to be happy
and a passionate devotee of the new ideas and of Speránski
and a diligent Petersburg newsmonger—one of those men who choose their opinions like their clothes according to the fashion
but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest partisans
Hardly had he got rid of his hat before he ran into Prince Andrew’s room with a preoccupied air and at once began talking
It had been a speech such as only constitutional monarchs deliver
The Sovereign plainly said that the Council and Senate are estates of the realm
he said that the government must rest not on authority but on secure bases
Prince Andrew listened to the account of the opening of the Council of State
He listened with quiet irony to Bítski’s enthusiastic account of it
The prospect of that dinner in the intimate home circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested Prince Andrew
found the friendly gathering of Speránski’s intimate acquaintances already assembled at five o’clock
While still in the anteroom Prince Andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato laugh—a laugh such as one hears on the stage
Someone—it sounded like Speránski—was distinctly ejaculating ha-ha-ha
wearing a gray swallow-tail coat with a star on the breast
and Speránski was laughing in advance at what Magnítski was going to say
When Prince Andrew entered the room Magnítski’s words were again crowned by laughter
and turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh
It seemed to him that this was not Speránski but someone else
Everything that had formerly appeared mysterious and fascinating in Speránski suddenly became plain and unattractive
At dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes
It seemed that in this company the insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored ridicule
Gervais gave a long account of an official revision
broke into the conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed under the former order of things—threatening to give a serious turn to the conversation
But their gaiety seemed to Prince Andrew mirthless and tiresome
Speránski’s high-pitched voice struck him unpleasantly
and the incessant laughter grated on him like a false note
Prince Andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damper on the spirits of the company
but it lacked just that something which is the salt of mirth
and they were not even aware that such a thing existed
After dinner Speránski’s daughter and her governess rose
The men remained at table over their port—English fashion
with an evident wish to prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant course
All rose and continuing to talk loudly went into the drawing room
Two letters brought by a courier were handed to Speránski and he took them to his study
and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have expected anything from Speránski and from any of his own activities connected with him
mirthless laughter rang in Prince Andrew’s ears long after he had left the house
had already been prepared and submitted to the Emperor
He thought of the meetings of a committee of which Berg was a member
He remembered how carefully and at what length everything relating to form and procedure was discussed at those meetings
his journey to Ryazán; he remembered the peasants and Dron the village elder
and mentally applying to them the Personal Rights he had divided into paragraphs
he felt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such useless work
CHAPTER XIX  Next day Prince Andrew called at a few houses he had not visited before
and among them at the Rostóvs’ with whom he had renewed acquaintance at the ball
She was wearing a dark-blue house dress in which Prince Andrew thought her even prettier than in her ball dress
which struck one especially in Petersburg as a pleasant surprise
that in the Otrádnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night had already begun to disconcert him
Now this world disconcerted him no longer and was no longer alien to him
Prince Andrew stood by a window talking to the ladies and listened to her
This contrast weighed on and yet cheered him while she sang
and said he liked her singing as he liked everything she did
then lay down again not at all troubled by his sleeplessness: his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he had stepped out of a stuffy room into God’s own fresh air
And for the first time for a very long while he began making happy plans for the future
He decided that he must attend to his son’s education by finding a tutor and putting the boy in his charge
Count  (Berg said this with perfect conviction that this information could not but be agreeable)
and why though he grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful
sat beside his wife explaining to her that one always could and should be acquainted with people above one
It goes without saying that one must be conscientious and methodical
This is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself
and order; so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that Berg
having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair or of the sofa for his dear guest
but being apparently painfully undecided on the matter himself
eventually left the visitor to settle the question of selection
Pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a chair for himself
and Berg and Véra immediately began their evening party
having decided that masculine conversation was required
interrupted his wife’s remarks and touched on the question of the war with Austria
and unconsciously jumped from the general subject to personal considerations as to the proposals made him to take part in the Austrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them
and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other evening parties
At the card table he happened to be directly facing Natásha
flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing
And the bright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was again alight in her
and the latter noticed a new and youthful expression in his friend’s face
Pierre changed places several times during the game
sitting now with his back to Natásha and now facing her
Natásha on one side was talking with Sónya and Borís
began a conversation with him about feelings in general and about her sister
With so intellectual a guest as she considered Prince Andrew to be
she felt that she had to employ her diplomatic tact
continued Véra—mentioning  our days  as people of limited intelligence are fond of doing
imagining that they have discovered and appraised the peculiarities of  our days  and that human characteristics change with the times— in our days a girl has so much freedom that the pleasure of being courted often stifles real feeling in her
And it must be confessed that Natalie is very susceptible
This return to the subject of Natalie caused Prince Andrew to knit his brows with discomfort: he was about to rise
seeing his friend’s strange animation with surprise
and with a strange light in his eyes and restlessness in his movements
Prince Andrew approached Natásha and sat down beside her
Pierre saw how Prince Andrew asked her something and how she flushed as she replied
and the samovar and the tea cakes; only one thing was lacking that he had always seen at the evening parties he wished to imitate
They had not yet had a loud conversation among the men and a dispute about something important and clever
Prince Andrew dined with the Rostóvs and spent the rest of the day there
Everyone in the house realized for whose sake Prince Andrew came
and without concealing it he tried to be with Natásha all day
there was a feeling of awe at something important that was bound to happen
The countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyes at Prince Andrew when he talked to Natásha and timidly started some artificial conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her way
And it had to happen that he should come specially to Petersburg while we are here
shedding tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother
At that very time Prince Andrew was sitting with Pierre and telling him of his love for Natásha and his firm resolve to make her his wife
Since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression and had made desperate efforts to combat it
Since the intimacy of his wife with the royal prince
Pierre had unexpectedly been made a gentleman of the bedchamber
and from that time he had begun to feel oppressed and ashamed in court society
and dark thoughts of the vanity of all things human came to him oftener than before
and about Natásha and Prince Andrew; and again everything seemed to him insignificant in comparison with eternity; again the question: for what
presented itself; and he forced himself to work day and night at Masonic labors
Pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind to speak openly; and to him he told all that was in his soul
Now he boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future
said he could not sacrifice his own happiness to his father’s caprice
and spoke of how he would either make his father consent to this marriage and love her
It is not at all the same feeling that I knew in the past
CHAPTER XXIII  Prince Andrew needed his father’s consent to his marriage
and to obtain this he started for the country next day
look out as you wanted to for a German tutor for Prince Nicholas
in a tone which showed that nothing would make him alter his decision
or that he (the old prince himself) would die before then
Natásha had no desire to go out anywhere and wandered from room to room like a shadow
but recovered and went on quietly:   And I don’t at all want to get married
The day after this conversation Natásha put on the old dress which she knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the mornings
and that day she returned to the old way of life which she had abandoned since the ball
Having finished her morning tea she went to the ballroom
When she had finished her first exercise she stood still in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase that particularly pleased her
A footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but she would not let him
and having closed the door behind him continued her walk
and in nobody’s way if only they leave her in peace
I have not been to see you all this time because I have been at my father’s
but was unable to do so: something gripped her throat
and did not find in his heart his former love for her
Something in him had suddenly changed; there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of desire
trying but failing to take in the meaning of his words
The father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple their blessing
From that day Prince Andrew began to frequent the Rostóvs’ as Natásha’s affianced lover
CHAPTER XXIV  No betrothal ceremony took place and Natásha’s engagement to Bolkónski was not announced; Prince Andrew insisted on that
He said that as he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole burden of it; that he had given his word and bound himself forever
but that he did not wish to bind Natásha and gave her perfect freedom
If after six months she felt that she did not love him she would have full right to reject him
It was as if they had not known each other till now
At first the family felt some constraint in intercourse with Prince Andrew; he seemed a man from another world
and for a long time Natásha trained the family to get used to him
Sometimes the household both among themselves and in his presence expressed their wonder at how it had all happened
and at the evident omens there had been of it: Prince Andrew’s coming to Otrádnoe and their coming to Petersburg
and many other incidents betokening that it had to be
In the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always accompanies the presence of a betrothed couple
Often when all sitting together everyone kept silent
and ask his advice about Pétya’s education or Nicholas’ service
When Prince Andrew spoke (he could tell a story very well)
Natásha listened to him with pride; when she spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed attentively and scrutinizingly at her
She asked herself in perplexity:  What does he look for in me
but when he did he abandoned himself entirely to his laughter
and after such a laugh she always felt nearer to him
Natásha would have been completely happy if the thought of the separation awaiting her and drawing near had not terrified her
just as the mere thought of it made him turn pale and cold
On the eve of his departure from Petersburg Prince Andrew brought with him Pierre
nor Prince Andrew himself could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would act on Natásha
she said in a tone that made him wonder whether he really ought not to stay and which he remembered long afterwards
Nor did she cry when he was gone; but for several days she sat in her room dry-eyed
as a child gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of face
CHAPTER XXV  During that year after his son’s departure
and it was Princess Mary who generally bore the brunt of his frequent fits of unprovoked anger
He seemed carefully to seek out her tender spots so as to torture her mentally as harshly as possible
and religion—and these were the favorite subjects of the prince’s attacks and ridicule
he would ask her in Princess Mary’s presence how she liked our village priests and icons and would joke about them
The princess never thought of that proud word  justice
All the complex laws of man centered for her in one clear and simple law—the law of love and self-sacrifice taught us by Him who lovingly suffered for mankind though He Himself was God
Before he left he had a long talk with his father about something
Princess Mary wrote to her friend Julie Karágina in Petersburg
whom she had dreamed (as all girls dream) of marrying to her brother
can—I will not say comfort us—but save us from despair
and one I shall never forget—that of my dear sister-in-law—left that impression on me
she was too angelically innocent to have the strength to perform all a mother’s duties
only to convince you of the Gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life: not a single hair of our heads will fall without His will
You will be surprised to hear that the reason for this is Buonaparte
The case is this: my father’s health is growing noticeably worse
It seems to me that it is chiefly because of his political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to Moscow; for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way of expressing his views regardless of anybody
After his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits
On his arrival in Petersburg he received only his due
I always wonder at the way rumors fly from Petersburg to Moscow
I know that though he rarely speaks about the wife he has lost
MARY      CHAPTER XXVI  In the middle of the summer Princess Mary received an unexpected letter from Prince Andrew in Switzerland in which he gave her strange and surprising news
He informed her of his engagement to Natásha Rostóva
The whole letter breathed loving rapture for his betrothed and tender and confiding affection for his sister
He wrote that he had never loved as he did now and that only now did he understand and know what life was
He had not done so for fear Princess Mary should ask her father to give his consent
the matter was not then so definitely settled as it is now
If the doctors did not keep me here at the spas I should be back in Russia
I have been and always shall be independent; but to go against his will and arouse his anger
Write and tell him that he may marry tomorrow if he likes
After this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matter
But repressed vexation at his son’s poor-spirited behavior found expression in his treatment of his daughter
Princess Mary noticed that her father was really associating more and more with the Frenchwoman
She wrote to Prince Andrew about the reception of his letter
Princess Mary in the profoundest depths of her heart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief consolation of her life
the more experience and observation she had of life
but that was not enough: he wanted to bind his happiness to another woman
Her father objected to this because he wanted a more distinguished and wealthier match for Andrew
in order without clinging to anything to wander in hempen rags from place to place under an assumed name
a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty called Theodosia
when in a room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon Theodosia was talking of her life
the thought that Theodosia alone had found the true path of life suddenly came to Princess Mary with such force that she resolved to become a pilgrim herself
mechanical to them but to her so full of deep meaning
that several times she was on the point of abandoning everything and running away from home
and felt that she was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than God
but the curse weighs on the race not only because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows
but because our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at ease
An inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle
If man could find a state in which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling his duty
he would have found one of the conditions of man’s primitive blessedness
And such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness is the lot of a whole class—the military
The chief attraction of military service has consisted and will consist in this compulsory and irreproachable idleness
he found in letters from home more frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling into greater and greater disorder
He felt that sooner or later he would have to re-enter that whirlpool of life
in which they told him of Natásha’s engagement to Bolkónski
he regretted not to have been there to show that fellow Bolkónski that connection with him was no such great honor after all
and that if he loved Natásha he might dispense with permission from his dotard father
She wrote that if he did not come and take matters in hand
Why he had to go he did not know; but after his after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars
an extremely vicious gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time
and when he returned with the horse all in a lather
he informed Lavrúshka (Denísov’s servant who had remained with him) and his comrades who turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was going home
Difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would go away without having heard from the staff—and this interested him extremely—whether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the Order of St
Anne for the last maneuvers; strange as it was to think that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the Polish Count Golukhovski
who was bargaining for the horses Rostóv had betted he would sell for two thousand rubles; incomprehensible as it seemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the Polish Mademoiselle Przazdziecka (out of rivalry to the Uhlans who had given one in honor of their Polish Mademoiselle Borzozowska) would take place without him—he knew he must go away from this good
His hussar comrades—not only those of his own regiment
but the whole brigade—gave Rostóv a dinner to which the subscription was fifteen rubles a head
and at which there were two bands and two choirs of singers
and then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first post station
and to wonder anxiously how things would be at Otrádnoe and what he would find there
Thoughts of home grew stronger the nearer he approached it—far stronger
as though this feeling of his was subject to the law by which the force of attraction is in inverse proportion to the square of the distance
She did not seem at all like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband
She was even-tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old
especially as he had not seen her with Prince Andrew
And don’t attach importance to her being so bright: that’s because she’s living through the last days of her girlhood
CHAPTER II  After reaching home Nicholas was at first serious and even dull
angry and scowling and without answering questions as to where he was going
to Mítenka’s lodge and demanded an account of everything
But what an account of everything might be Nicholas knew even less than the frightened and bewildered Mítenka
Mítenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the shrubbery
who heard at once from the maids what had happened at the lodge
was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would certainly improve
but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect this excitement might have on her son
that I should never understand anything in this crazy world
You were angry that he had not entered those 700 rubles
I used to understand what a ‘corner’ and the stakes at cards meant
and after that he did not meddle in business affairs
young Rostóv took no further part in any business affairs
but devoted himself with passionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new pursuit—the chase—for which his father kept a large establishment
CHAPTER III  The weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed an earth saturated by autumn rains
The verdure had thickened and its bright green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter rye trodden down by the cattle
which at the end of August had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble
had become golden and bright-red islands amid the green winter rye
The hounds of that ardent young sportsman Rostóv had not merely reached hard winter condition
he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting: it was as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any wind
The bare twigs in the garden were hung with transparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves
that inimitable huntsman’s call which unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor
and that look of independence and scorn of everything that is only seen in huntsmen
for fear of breaking something in the master’s apartment
But just as Daniel was about to go Natásha came in with rapid steps
It seemed to Daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all
but to have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible
He cast down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his business
who had always kept up an enormous hunting establishment but had now handed it all completely over to his son’s care
with a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for attending to trifles
with the borzois on the leash belonging to members of the family
along the road and field leading to the Otrádnoe covert
The horses stepped over the field as over a thick carpet
now and then splashing into puddles as they crossed a road
Natásha sat easily and confidently on her black Arábchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand
Uncle  looked round disapprovingly at Pétya and Natásha
having finally settled with  Uncle  where they should set on the hounds
and washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite Bordeaux
He was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive
kept glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms for thirty years
and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant chat
A third person rode up circumspectly through the wood (it was plain that he had had a lesson) and stopped behind the count
How he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the Zavárzinsk thicket the other day
turning back the skirt of his coat to get at his snuffbox
holding the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any
After the cry of the hounds came the deep tones of the wolf call from Daniel’s hunting horn; the pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry
and it was with this that Daniel’s voice was heard calling ulyulyu
as if the hounds in full cry and Daniel ulyulyuing were just in front of them
The count turned and saw on his right Mítka staring at him with eyes starting out of his head
in a voice plainly showing that he had long fretted to utter that word
and letting the borzois slip he galloped toward the count
was coming at a quiet lope farther to the left to the very place where they were standing
sprang helter-skelter from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed across the field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared
and as if scorning to say more to the frightened and shamefaced count
but it vanished into the wood before they could do so
Several times he addressed a prayer to God that the wolf should come his way
but for God’s sake do let the old wolf come my way and let Karáy spring at it—in sight of ‘Uncle’ who is watching from over there—and seize it by the throat in a death grip
A thousand times during that half-hour Rostóv cast eager and restless glances over the edge of the wood
straining eyes and ears and looking to the left and then to the right and listening to the slightest variation of note in the cries of the dogs
that Rostóv could not believe his eyes and remained in doubt for over a second
The wolf ran forward and jumped heavily over a gully that lay in her path
They stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation
Old Karáy had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas
Nicholas asked himself as the wolf approached him coming from the copse
Suddenly the wolf’s whole physiognomy changed: she shuddered
now she was ahead of it; but the wolf turned its head to face her
But the quickness of the wolf’s lope and the borzoi’s slower pace made it plain that Karáy had miscalculated
rushed impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over
Thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolf’s path
But here Nicholas only saw that something happened to Karáy—the borzoi was suddenly on the wolf
when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully with the dogs
while from under them could be seen her gray hair and outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head
when she suddenly thrust her head up from among that mass of dogs
and then her forepaws were on the edge of the gully
She clicked her teeth (Karáy no longer had her by the throat)
shouting and preparing to dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back
holding a naked dagger in his left hand and thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if it were a flail
The hounds had killed two of the cubs and the borzois three
with her broad-browed head hanging down and the bitten stick between her jaws
At midday they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees
there his own huntsman stood alone in a hollow behind a hazel bush
rushed along the ravine toward the ryefield and away from Nicholas
and was expecting a fox to show itself at any moment on the ryefield opposite
when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed in followed by a black one
and everything was in confusion; the borzois formed a star-shaped figure
scarcely swaying their bodies and with tails turned away from the center of the group
Nicholas sent the man to call Natásha and Pétya to him
and rode at a footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds together
While still at a distance he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully
with whom the Rostóvs had a quarrel and were at law
firmly grasping his whip and fully prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his enemy
Ilágin raised his beaver cap and said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the man punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone else’s borzois
and Ilágin kept stealthily glancing at one another’s dogs
trying not to be observed by their companions and searching uneasily for rivals to their own borzois
and in that beautiful bitch saw a rival to his own Mílka
And considering it polite to return the young count’s compliment
Ilágin looked at his borzois and picked out Mílka who attracted his attention by her breadth
involuntarily by this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on this red borzoi
The pack on leash rushed downhill in full cry after the hare
seeing only the borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even for an instant of the chase
but in front of him was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft
but when close to the hare’s scut paused as if measuring the distance
At the very moment when she would have seized her prey
and anxiously glancing round with restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched
panting and looking wrathfully around as if he were abusing someone
as if they were all his enemies and had insulted him
and so piercingly that it set everyone’s ear tingling
By that shriek she expressed what the others expressed by all talking at once
and only much later were they able to regain their former affectation of indifference
For a long time they continued to look at red Rugáy who
his arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring of his leash
CHAPTER VII  Toward evening Ilágin took leave of Nicholas
who found that they were so far from home that he accepted  Uncle’s  offer that the hunting party should spend the night in his little village of Mikháylovna
Uncle  led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with a folding table and red chairs
then into the drawing room with a round birchwood table and a sofa
Leading from the study was a passage in which a partition with ragged curtains could be seen
They looked at one another (now that the hunt was over and they were in the house
the very one she had regarded with surprise and amusement at Otrádnoe
was just the right thing and not at all worse than a swallow-tail or frock coat
which caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and throw back her head
as she offered Natásha first one thing and then another
while Natásha sat upright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes
She tried several times to wake Pétya that he might eat something
but he only muttered incoherent words without waking up
Uncle’s  face was very significant and even handsome as he said this
Involuntarily Rostóv recalled all the good he had heard about him from his father and the neighbors
elected him to be a justice and to other posts; but he always persistently refused public appointments
and an unseen hand opened the door into the huntsmen’s room
said Nicholas with some unintentional superciliousness
The balaláyka was retuned several times and the same notes were thrummed again
but the listeners did not grow weary of it and wished to hear it again and again
began to thrill in the hearts of Nicholas and Natásha
looking with a changed and inspired expression at the spot where Anísya Fëdorovna had just stood
Something seemed to be laughing a little on one side of his face under his gray mustaches
and it was as if there were two men in him: one of them smiled seriously at the merry fellow
reared in silks and velvets and so different from herself
But as soon as she had said it a new train of thoughts and feelings arose in her
She resolved to give up learning the harp and to play only the guitar
Uncle  wrapped Natásha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness
his voice called out of the darkness—not the voice Natásha had known previously
but the one that had sung As ‘twas growing dark last night
but only heard them splashing through the unseen mud
first I thought that we are driving along and imagining that we are going home
but that heaven knows where we are really going in the darkness
and he thought:  How charming this Natásha of mine is
pointing to the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the moist velvety darkness of the night
Natásha and Nicholas often noticed their parents conferring together anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of selling the fine ancestral Rostóv house and estate near Moscow
It was not necessary to entertain so freely as when the count had been Marshal
and life at Otrádnoe was quieter than in former years
but still the enormous house and its lodges were full of people and more than twenty sat down to table every day
but the old habits of life without which the count and countess could not conceive of existence remained unchanged
There was still the hunting establishment which Nicholas had even enlarged
the same fifty horses and fifteen grooms in the stables
the same expensive presents and dinner parties to the whole district on name days; there were still the count’s games of whist and boston
at which—spreading out his cards so that everybody could see them—he let himself be plundered of hundreds of rubles every day by his neighbors
trying not to believe that he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every step
that it was not the count’s fault for he could not help being what he was—that (though he tried to hide it) he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and his children’s ruin
and she tried to find means of remedying the position
She felt this to be their last hope and that if Nicholas refused the match she had found for him
and who had now become a wealthy heiress through the death of the last of her brothers
The countess had written direct to Julie’s mother in Moscow suggesting a marriage between their children and had received a favorable answer from her
Karágina had replied that for her part she was agreeable
She said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that were accomplished
Then she told him that she knew of a splendid girl and tried to discover what he thought about marriage
At other times she praised Julie to him and advised him to go to Moscow during the holidays to amuse himself
Nicholas guessed what his mother’s remarks were leading to and during one of these conversations induced her to speak quite frankly
I would sacrifice anything for you—even my feelings
Yet I should certainly be happier with her than with some doll-like Julie
and using the formal  you  instead of the intimate  thou  in speaking to her
that there were no grounds for finding fault with her
in which he wrote that he would have been on his way back to Russia long ago had not his wound unexpectedly reopened in the warm climate
which obliged him to defer his return till the beginning of the new year
and was still as ready to throw herself into all the pleasures of life as before; but at the end of the fourth month of their separation she began to have fits of depression which she could not master
CHAPTER IX  Christmas came and except for the ceremonial Mass
There an old maidservant was grumbling at a young girl who stood panting
Natásha crossed the dancing hall and went to the vestibule
she ran quickly upstairs to see Vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story
and began to run her fingers over the strings in the bass
picking out a passage she recalled from an opera she had heard in Petersburg with Prince Andrew
What she drew from the guitar would have had no meaning for other listeners
but in her imagination a whole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds
Sónya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand
Natásha glanced at her and at the crack in the pantry door
and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs
I have felt like that when everything was all right and everyone was cheerful
And do you remember how we rolled hard-boiled eggs in the ballroom
Much that they remembered had slipped from her mind
and what she recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced
She simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it
She only really took part when they recalled Sónya’s first arrival
It was dark in the room especially where they were sitting on the sofa
but through the big windows the silvery light of the full moon fell on the floor
Dimmler had finished the piece but still sat softly running his fingers over the strings
wanted to break off their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room
but Natásha got up and Nicholas sat down at the clavichord
while Mítenka stood in front of him also listening and smiling
thought of the immense difference there was between herself and her friend
and how impossible it was for her to be anything like as bewitching as her cousin
but her tears still flowed and sobs still choked her
then hiding behind one another they pushed into the ballroom where
and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her
Some inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided
and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and small bells
Two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs
the third was the old count’s with a trotter from the Orlóv stud as shaft horse
It was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal harness disks and from the eyes of the horses
At first they drove at a steady trot along the narrow road
went the first sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of the road
When they came out onto the beaten highroad—polished by sleigh runners and cut up by rough-shod hoofs
already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing farther and farther off
pulling the reins to one side and flourishing the whip
and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses to gallop—the other sleighs followed
The shaft horse swung steadily beneath the bow over its head
Nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed Zakhár
The horses showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh—beside them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing
But here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows
surrounded by her daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling dull
They were quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at the shadows the wax figures would throw on the wall
after clearing their throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule
came into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted
having given orders to clear the rooms for the visitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs
went about among the mummers without removing her spectacles
peering into their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to recognize any of them
as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by the dancers
and she thanked them all for having entertained her so well
The visitors were invited to supper in the drawing room
and the serfs had something served to them in the ballroom
and prettier than Nicholas had ever seen her before
His bosom seemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and gladness
From the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps
She was only a couple of paces away when she saw him
On the way back Nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing and kept peering by that fantastic all-transforming light into Sónya’s face and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and his present Sónya from whom he had resolved never to be parted again
He looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new Sónya
and that Sónya was certainly his future happy and loving wife
Natásha got the glass she held into the right position opposite the other; her face assumed a serious expression and she sat silent
whispered Dunyásha;  while you do nothing but laugh
and without replying to Sónya’s words of comfort she got into bed
and long after her candle was out lay open-eyed and motionless
gazing at the moonlight through the frosty windowpanes
who had long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this declaration
listened to him in silence and then told her son that he might marry whom he pleased
but unable to restrain herself she burst into tears of vexation and left the room
The old count began irresolutely to admonish Nicholas and beg him to abandon his purpose
the count was always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the family fortune
he was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had not been in disorder
no better wife for Nicholas than Sónya could have been wished for
and that no one but himself with his Mítenka and his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family finances
The father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again
reproached her niece for trying to catch Nicholas and for ingratitude
She was ready to sacrifice everything for her benefactors
She could not help loving the countess and the whole Rostóv family
Nicholas felt the situation to be intolerable and went to have an explanation with his mother
He first implored her to forgive him and Sónya and consent to their marriage
But he had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of his face caused his mother to await with terror
who conscious that they had been on the brink of a rupture gazed at her son with terror
and so far succeeded that Nicholas received a promise from his mother that Sónya should not be troubled
left at the beginning of January to rejoin his regiment
Sónya was unhappy at the separation from Nicholas and still more so on account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting toward her
seeing new places and new people that interested him
and in the rough copies of which the countess corrected her mistakes in spelling
There was still no improvement in the countess’ health
but it was impossible to defer the journey to Moscow any longer
BOOK EIGHT: 1811 - 12      CHAPTER I  After Prince Andrew’s engagement to Natásha
Pierre without any apparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before
Firmly convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his benefactor
and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man
to which he had devoted himself with such ardor—all the zest of such a life vanished after the engagement of Andrew and Natásha and the death of Joseph Alexéevich
he saw the Iberian shrine with innumerable tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons
the Krémlin Square with its snow undisturbed by vehicles
and books—no one and nothing met with a refusal from him
There was never a dinner or soiree at the club without him
his kindly smile and well-timed jests reconciled the antagonists
The Masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not there
When after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile
yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere with them
Pierre was one of those retired gentlemen-in-waiting of whom there were hundreds good-humoredly ending their days in Moscow
and his own progress to the highest degree of perfection
For a long time he could not reconcile himself to the idea that he was one of those same retired Moscow gentlemen-in-waiting he had so despised seven years before
while I am still discontented and want to do something for mankind
and race—by that elemental force against which man is powerless—to the condition I am in
he would ask himself in perplexity several times a day
Napoleon Bonaparte was despised by all as long as he was great
offer praise because on that same fourteenth of June they defeated the Spaniards
My brother Masons swear by the blood that they are ready to sacrifice everything for their neighbor
and fuss about an authentic Scotch carpet and a charter that nobody needs
and the meaning of which the very man who wrote it does not understand
We all profess the Christian law of forgiveness of injuries and love of our neighbors
have of seeing and believing in the possibility of goodness and truth
It was too dreadful to be under the burden of these insoluble problems
from sleeping to gossip in drawing rooms of the club
Drinking became more and more a physical and also a moral necessity
and a readiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it deeply
Only after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the terribly tangled skein of life which previously had terrified him was not as dreadful as he had thought
He was always conscious of some aspect of that skein
as with a buzzing in his head after dinner or supper he chatted or listened to conversation or read
CHAPTER II  At the beginning of winter Prince Nicholas Bolkónski and his daughter moved to Moscow
together with his past and his intellect and his originality
and the childish vanity with which he accepted the role of head of the Moscow opposition
and the stern shrewd old man (himself a relic of the past century) with his gentle daughter and the pretty Frenchwoman who were reverently devoted to him presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle
But the visitors did not reflect that besides the couple of hours during which they saw their host
there were also twenty-two hours in the day during which the private and intimate life of the house continued
Latterly that private life had become very trying for Princess Mary
There in Moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures—talks with the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at Bald Hills—and she had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life
She did not go out into society; everyone knew that her father would not let her go anywhere without him
and his failing health prevented his going out himself
so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties
She had quite abandoned the hope of getting married
Julie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels that her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be decided now or never
On Thursdays Princess Mary remembered with a mournful smile that she now had no one to write to
since Julie—whose presence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week
Like the old émigré who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his evenings for years
The time for Prince Andrew’s return and marriage was approaching
for at every mention of the young Countess Rostóva the old prince (who apart from that was usually in a bad temper) lost control of himself
Another lately added sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six year-old nephew
To her consternation she detected in herself in relation to little Nicholas some symptoms of her father’s irritability
and sometimes pulled him by the arm and put him in the corner
But what distressed the princess most of all was her father’s irritability
which was always directed against her and had of late amounted to cruelty
it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard; but this loving despot—the more cruel because he loved her and for that reason tormented himself and her—knew how not merely to hurt and humiliate her deliberately
but to show her that she was always to blame for everything
Of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented Princess Mary more than anything else; this was his ever-increasing intimacy with Mademoiselle Bourienne
and as it seemed to Princess Mary merely to offend her
shown special endearments to the companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by demonstrations of love of Bourienne
Next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter
Princess Mary asked Mademoiselle Bourienne’s pardon
At such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her soul
at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him would suddenly fall asleep
It happened that on that morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods
He had been going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be understood himself
and she went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun and awaited the inevitable explosion
went up to Mademoiselle Bourienne who at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room
said Métivier; and putting his fingers to his lips he hastened away
as if afraid she might find some means of consolation
had been anxious to be presented to Prince Nicholas Bolkónski
and had contrived to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house
The prince’s house did not belong to what is known as fashionable society
but his little circle—though not much talked about in town—was one it was more flattering to be received in than any other
Lopukhín and the old general occasionally took part in the conversation
showing that he took heed of what was being reported to him
The tone of the conversation was such as indicated that no one approved of what was being done in the political world
Incidents were related evidently confirming the opinion that everything was going from bad to worse
at the point beyond which his criticism might touch the sovereign himself
repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before
One only wonders at the long-suffering or blindness of the crowned heads
Now the Pope’s turn has come and Bonaparte doesn’t scruple to depose the head of the Catholic Church—yet all keep silent
feeling that he had reached the limit beyond which censure was impossible
He shifts the Dukes about as I might move my serfs from Bald Hills to Boguchárovo or my Ryazán estates
He said this because on his journey from Petersburg he had had the honor of being presented to the Duke
I have read our protests about the Oldenburg affair and was surprised how badly the Note was worded
remarked Count Rostopchín in the casual tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him
Pierre looked at Rostopchín with naïve astonishment
Pierre now understood the count’s dissatisfaction with the wording of the Note
There in Petersburg they are always writing—not notes only but even new laws
There was a momentary pause in the conversation; the old general cleared his throat to draw attention
I heard something: he said something awkward in His Majesty’s presence
And he narrated his whole conversation with the French doctor and the reasons that convinced him that Métivier was a spy
and only the presence of visitors hindered his speaking of it to her now
Prince Nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the impending war
He said that our wars with Bonaparte would be disastrous so long as we sought alliances with the Germans and thrust ourselves into European affairs
into which we had been drawn by the Peace of Tilsit
and in regard to Bonaparte the only thing is to have an armed frontier and a firm policy
keeping hold of the hand and offering his cheek to be kissed
Following Rostopchín’s example the others also rose
CHAPTER IV  Princess Mary as she sat listening to the old men’s talk and faultfinding
understood nothing of what she heard; she only wondered whether the guests had all observed her father’s hostile attitude toward her
Princess Mary turned with absent-minded questioning look to Pierre
still thinking of that morning’s conversation with her father
Princess Mary told Pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future sister-in-law as soon as the Rostóvs arrived and to try to accustom the old prince to her
When they had last met on the old prince’s name day
but thought herself not merely as good-looking as before but even far more attractive
She was confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a very wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew the less dangerous she became to men
A man who would have been afraid ten years before of going every day to the house when there was a girl of seventeen there
for fear of compromising her and committing himself
would now go boldly every day and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance
That winter the Karágins’ house was the most agreeable and hospitable in Moscow
She adopted the tone of one who has suffered a great disappointment
like a girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by him
Though nothing of the kind had happened to her she was regarded in that light
did not hinder the young people who came to her house from passing the time pleasantly
and with these she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of all worldly things
Julie was particularly gracious: she regretted his early disillusionment with life
Borís sketched two trees in the album and wrote:  Rustic trees
and more than once interrupted the reading because of the emotions that choked him
while playing cards with the mother made careful inquiries as to Julie’s dowry (she was to have two estates in Pénza and the Nizhegórod forests)
Borís smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother
He laughed blandly at her naïve diplomacy but listened to what she had to say
and sometimes questioned her carefully about the Pénza and Nizhegórod estates
and sometimes the thought occurred to her that she was repulsive to him
but her feminine self-deception immediately supplied her with consolation
I know from a reliable source that Prince Vasíli has sent his son to Moscow to get him married to Julie
The idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that whole month of arduous melancholy service to Julie
and of seeing all the revenue from the Pénza estates which he had already mentally apportioned and put to proper use fall into the hands of another
Though Borís had come intentionally to speak of his love and therefore meant to be tender
and how their moods depend solely on who happens to be paying court to them
Julie was offended and replied that it was true that a woman needs variety
wishing to sting her; but at that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might have to leave Moscow without having accomplished his aim
lowered his eyes to avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face
There was no need to say more: Julie’s face shone with triumph and self-satisfaction; but she forced Borís to say all that is said on such occasions—that he loved her and had never loved any other woman more than her
no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom and melancholy upon them
CHAPTER VI  At the end of January old Count Rostóv went to Moscow with Natásha and Sónya
the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near Moscow had to be sold
besides which the opportunity of presenting his future daughter-in-law to old Prince Bolkónski while he was in Moscow could not be missed
The Rostóvs’ Moscow house had not been heated that winter and
as they had come only for a short time and the countess was not with them
a substantial and appetizing meal at which there were always three or four guests; after dinner she played a game of boston
and at night she had the newspapers or a new book read to her while she knitted
She rarely made an exception and went out to pay visits
and then only to the most important persons in the town
One might have thought she was angry with the travelers and would immediately turn them out
The other day young Princess Irína Vasílevna came to see me; she was an awful sight—looked as if she had put two barrels on her arms
One thing has come on top of another: her rags to buy
Next morning Márya Dmítrievna took the young ladies to the Iberian shrine of the Mother of God and to Madame Suppert-Roguet
who was so afraid of Márya Dmítrievna that she always let her have costumes at a loss merely to get rid of her
Márya Dmítrievna ordered almost the whole trousseau
Of course Prince Andrew is not a child and can shift without him
but really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her love of Prince Andrew
He well remembered the last interview he had had with the old prince at the time of the enrollment
half in earnest; but Natásha noticed that her father was flurried on entering the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince and princess were at home
When they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the servants
The footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by another in the large hall and they whispered to one another
The first person who came to meet the visitors was Mademoiselle Bourienne
Princess Mary was agitated just then because on the Rostóvs’ being announced
The count had devised this diplomatic ruse (as he afterwards told his daughter) to give the future sisters-in-law an opportunity to talk to one another freely
and looked at the princess with a bold and defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody
The princess told the count that she would be delighted
Despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by Princess Mary—who wished to have a tête-à-tête with Natásha—Mademoiselle Bourienne remained in the room and persistently talked about Moscow amusements and theaters
and after looking Natásha over from head to foot he went out
Mademoiselle Bourienne was the first to recover herself after this apparition and began speaking about the prince’s indisposition
Natásha and Princess Mary looked at one another in silence
who could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an hour with her without once mentioning Prince Andrew
pretended not to notice how upset Natásha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the count and the other guests
but could not refuse Márya Dmítrievna’s kind offer which was intended expressly for her
When she came ready dressed into the ballroom to await her father
and make him look at me with those searching inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me
passing among men and women who were entering and the program sellers
they all three went along the corridor to the first row of boxes
An attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and opened the door of their box
A lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy at Natásha
everybody knew vaguely of Natásha’s engagement to Prince Andrew
and knew that the Rostóvs had lived in the country ever since
and that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty
She struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty
combined with her indifference to everything about her
If only they knew how little I am concerned about any of them
Behind them sat Anna Mikháylovna wearing a green headdress and with a happy look of resignation to the will of God on her face
Their box was pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which Natásha knew so well and liked so much
She turned away and suddenly remembered all that had been so humiliating in her morning’s visit
well aware that he was attracting everyone’s attention
yet as much at ease as though he were in his own room
they offer him to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet
beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed plump white shoulders and neck
round which she wore a double string of large pearls
and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearls
CHAPTER IX  The floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards
In the center of the stage sat some girls in red bodices and white skirts
One very fat girl in a white silk dress sat apart on a low bench
then they both paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand of the girl in white
obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with her
They sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping and shouting
seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she herself experienced
but they all seemed attentive to what was happening on the stage
And feeling the bright light that flooded the whole place and the warm air heated by the crowd
the strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through her mind: the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box and singing the air the actress was singing
At a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song
saw an exceptionally handsome adjutant approaching their box with a self-assured yet courteous bearing
This was Anatole Kurágin whom she had seen and noticed long ago at the ball in Petersburg
He was now in an adjutant’s uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot
who did not exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his lips
Then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down beside Dólokhov
began to tell the count of some intrigue of Kurágin’s in Moscow
Hélène’s box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most distinguished and intellectual men
who seemed to vie with one another in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her
Natásha knew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure
She even turned so that he should see her profile in what she thought was its most becoming aspect
In the second act there was scenery representing tombstones
but sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off
and behind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and everyone knelt down and sang a prayer
All these things were repeatedly interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience
She was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and it did not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it
When the second act was over Countess Bezúkhova rose
turned to the Rostóvs’ box—her whole bosom completely exposed—beckoned the old count with a gloved finger
How is it you’re not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country
Countess Bezúkhova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinating woman
Though I am not staying here long this time—nor are you—I will try to amuse them
I have already heard much of you in Petersburg and wanted to get to know you
The scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the walls
sang something badly and sat down on a crimson throne
and men and women with bare legs came in from both sides and began dancing all together
Then one of the men went into a corner of the stage
The cymbals and horns in the orchestra struck up more loudly
and galleries began clapping and shouting with all their might
Once more there was a terrible noise and clatter among the audience
who was as handsome at close quarters as at a distance
sat down beside her and told her he had long wished to have this happiness—ever since the Narýshkins’ ball in fact
at which he had had the well-remembered pleasure of seeing her
yet his presence made her feel constrained and oppressed
When she was not looking at him she felt that he was looking at her shoulders
realizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she had always felt between herself and other men
She did not know how it was that within five minutes she had come to feel herself terribly near to this man
but Hélène was engaged in conversation with a general and did not answer her look
Natásha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did himself
but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper intention
She did not know what to say and turned away as if she had not heard his remark
now quite submissive to the world she found herself in
All that was going on before her now seemed quite natural
or of life in the country did not once recur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote past
In the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his arm about
till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeared down below
and the cause of this was Kurágin whom she could not help watching
Only after she had reached home was Natásha able clearly to think over what had happened to her
and suddenly remembering Prince Andrew she was horrified
She sat for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to realize what had happened to her
Only to the old countess at night in bed could Natásha have told all she was feeling
She knew that Sónya with her severe and simple views would either not understand it at all or would be horrified at such a confession
yet the former purity of her love for Prince Andrew had perished
and tender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm
CHAPTER XI  Anatole Kurágin was staying in Moscow because his father had sent him away from Petersburg
His father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the last time
but only on condition that he went to Moscow as adjutant to the commander in chief—a post his father had procured for him—and would at last try to make a good match there
from the time of his arrival Anatole had turned the heads of the Moscow ladies
and was at all the balls and parties of the best society
for a payment which he agreed to send to his father-in-law
He was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it was impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had never in his life done anything base
were persuaded of it too and did not refuse him either a leading place in society or money
and as according to his ideas there was nothing dishonorable in these tastes
associated with his old Petersburg comrade Kurágin and made use of him for his own ends
and connections as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set
and hair and expressed his intention of making love to her
Anatole had no notion and was incapable of considering what might come of such love-making
CHAPTER XII  The day after the opera the Rostóvs went nowhere and nobody came to see them
Márya Dmítrievna talked to the count about something which they concealed from Natásha
She suffered more now than during her first days in Moscow
To her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant recollection of her interview with Princess Mary and the old prince
and a fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause
She continually fancied that either he would never come or that something would happen to her before he came
The question again presented itself whether she was not guilty
whether she had not already broken faith with Prince Andrew
but she was far less tranquil and happy than before
Márya Dmítrievna liked Sundays and knew how to keep them
and the servants had vodka and roast goose or suckling pig
Just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and only tacked together
and was turning her head to see in the glass how the back fitted
Mademoiselle George will recite at my house tonight and there’ll be some people
and if you don’t bring your lovely girls—who are prettier than Mademoiselle George—I won’t know you
whom she knew and who had curtsied respectfully to her
and seated herself in an armchair beside the looking glass
draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely
She felt happy and as if she were blossoming under the praise of this dear Countess Bezúkhova who had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and important and was now so kind to her
Hélène for her part was sincerely delighted with Natásha and wished to give her a good time
Anatole had asked her to bring him and Natásha together
and she was calling on the Rostóvs for that purpose
As she was leaving the Rostóvs she called her protégée aside
Márya Dmítrievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious
having evidently suffered a defeat at the old prince’s
She was still too agitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly
In answer to the count’s inquiries she replied that things were all right and that she would tell about it next day
On hearing of Countess Bezúkhova’s visit and the invitation for that evening
Count Rostóv was displeased to see that the company consisted almost entirely of men and women known for the freedom of their conduct
among them Métivier who from the time Hélène reached Moscow had been an intimate in her house
Immediately after greeting the count he went up to Natásha and followed her
As soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had had at the opera—gratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at the absence of a moral barrier between them
Hélène welcomed Natásha delightedly and was loud in admiration of her beauty and her dress
Soon after their arrival Mademoiselle George went out of the room to change her costume
In the drawing room people began arranging the chairs and taking their seats
but neither saw nor heard nor understood anything of what went on before her
and conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of expectancy
looked about her with wide-open frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual
Later on she recalled how she had asked her father to let her go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress
that Hélène had followed her and spoken laughingly of her brother’s love
After reaching home Natásha did not sleep all night
She was tormented by the insoluble question whether she loved Anatole or Prince Andrew
unable to find an answer to these terrible questions
Natásha kept looking uneasily at everybody with wide-open eyes
Natásha did not reply and went to her own room to read Princess Mary’s letter
she begged Natásha to believe that she could not help loving her as the one chosen by her brother
He is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven; but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happy
Princess Mary went on to ask Natásha to fix a time when she could see her again
and to escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to Sónya and began sorting patterns with her
Can it be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went before
She vividly pictured herself as Prince Andrew’s wife
she sometimes asked herself in complete bewilderment
whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious air
or else how could that have happened which had happened
And how could she have a love letter from him in her hand
With trembling hands Natásha held that passionate love letter which Dólokhov had composed for Anatole
and as she read it she found in it an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling
reading the letter for the twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of it
CHAPTER XV  On returning late in the evening Sónya went to Natásha’s room
Natásha went to the table and without a moment’s reflection wrote that answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all the morning
In this letter she said briefly that all their misunderstandings were at an end; that availing herself of the magnanimity of Prince Andrew who when he went abroad had given her her freedom
On Friday the Rostóvs were to return to the country
and that all through dinner she was more agitated than ever
Sónya did not succumb to the tender tone Natásha used toward her
Natásha did not speak to Sónya again and avoided her
and then listening at the door learned that another letter had been delivered
CHAPTER XVI  Anatole had lately moved to Dólokhov’s
Natásha had promised to come out to Kurágin at the back porch at ten that evening
Kurágin was to put her into a troyka he would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of Kámenka
where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a marriage ceremony over them
At Kámenka a relay of horses was to wait which would take them to the Warsaw highroad
where his French valet and others were packing the last of his things
evidently not listening to Dólokhov and looking straight before him with a smile that did not leave his face
with the partiality dull-witted people have for any conclusion they have reached by their own reasoning
repeated the argument he had already put to Dólokhov a hundred times
called a footman whom he ordered to bring something for them to eat and drink before the journey
and went into the room where Khvóstikov and Makárin were sitting
Anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling pensively
Balagá was a famous troyka driver who had known Dólokhov and Anatole some six years and had given them good service with his troykas
More than once he had enabled Dólokhov to escape when pursued
More than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies and  ladykins  as he called the cocottes
and more than once they had made him drunk on champagne and Madeira
which he loved; and he knew more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have sent an ordinary man to Siberia
They often called Balagá into their orgies and made him drink and dance at the gypsies’
and more than one thousand rubles of their money had passed through his hands
In their service he risked his skin and his life twenty times a year
and in their service had lost more horses than the money he had from them would buy
But he liked them; liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour
liked upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian
But with  his gentlemen  he always drove himself and never demanded anything for his work
CHAPTER XVII  Anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing a fur coat girt with a silver belt
Anatole evidently wished to make something touching and solemn out of this address to his comrades
she’ll rush out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing; if you delay at all there’ll be tears and ‘Papa’ and ‘Mamma
Two troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers were holding the horses
The shouting of Balagá and of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could be heard
and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old Konyúsheny Street
had remained at the wicket gate and was struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it
Pushing back Natásha who looked at her with astonished but tearless eyes
and having told the footman to bring them up to her
she seated herself in the drawing room to await the abductors
and clasping her hands behind her paced through the rooms a long time considering what she should do
Márya Dmítrievna glanced round at Sónya and seated herself on the sofa beside Natásha
She put her large hand under Natásha’s face and turned it toward her
And she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which people bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned
Márya Dmítrievna went on admonishing her for some time
said Márya Dmítrievna as she went out of the room supposing Natásha to be asleep
But Natásha was not asleep; with pale face and fixed wide-open eyes she looked straight before her
All that night she did not sleep or weep and did not speak to Sónya who got up and went to her several times
Next day Count Rostóv returned from his estate near Moscow in time for lunch as he had promised
He was in very good spirits; the affair with the purchaser was going on satisfactorily
uneasily watching the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round at anyone who entered the room
She was evidently expecting news of him and that he would come or would write to her
When the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the sound of a man’s footstep
In reply to the count’s anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected and whether anything had happened to her betrothed
she assured him that nothing had happened and asked him not to worry
and by the embarrassed faces of Sónya and Márya Dmítrievna
the count saw clearly that something had gone wrong during his absence
that he avoided inquiries and tried to assure himself that nothing particularly had happened; and he was only dissatisfied that her indisposition delayed their return to the country
who had long since promised to hand over to him some papers of her deceased husband’s
When he returned to Moscow Pierre was handed a letter from Márya Dmítrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great importance relating to Andrew Bolkónski and his betrothed
thought he as he dressed to go to Márya Dmítrievna’s
In a sleigh drawn by two gray trotting-horses that were bespattering the dashboard with snow
Anatole and his constant companion Makárin dashed past
Anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of military dandies
In Márya Dmítrievna’s anteroom the footman who helped him off with his fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom
For fifty-eight years have I lived in this world and never known anything so disgraceful
And having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him
That Prince Andrew’s deeply loved affianced wife—the same Natásha Rostóva who used to be so charming—should give up Bolkónski for that fool Anatole who was already secretly married (as Pierre knew)
and should be so in love with him as to agree to run away with him
was something Pierre could not conceive and could not imagine
reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunate enough to be tied to a bad woman
But still he pitied Prince Andrew to the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded pride
and the more he pitied his friend the more did he think with contempt and even with disgust of that Natásha who had just passed him in the ballroom with such a look of cold dignity
After hearing the details of Anatole’s marriage from Pierre
and giving vent to her anger against Anatole in words of abuse
if they knew of this affair (which she hoped to hide from them) might challenge Anatole to a duel
and she therefore asked Pierre to tell his brother-in-law in her name to leave Moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again
Have you heard she has broken off her engagement without consulting anybody
Natásha is not quite well; she’s in her room and would like to see you
And clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the room
When Márya Dmítrievna told Natásha that Anatole was married
Natásha did not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by Pierre himself
dropping his eyes with a feeling of pity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do
In the evening he drove to his sister’s to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting
When Pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over Moscow
Anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed anxiety
Having entered his study Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole without looking at him
answered Anatole (their whole conversation was in French)
expressing himself so artificially because he was talking French
you must understand that besides your pleasure there is such a thing as other people’s happiness and peace
and that you are ruining a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself
not looking at Pierre and with a slight tremor of his lower jaw
CHAPTER XXI  Pierre drove to Márya Dmítrievna’s to tell her of the fulfillment of her wish that Kurágin should be banished from Moscow
After swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she woke Sónya and told her what she had done
The necessary antidotes had been administered in time and she was now out of danger
assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his brother-in-law had proposed to her and been refused
It seemed to Pierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole affair and re-establish Natásha’s reputation
He was awaiting Prince Andrew’s return with dread and went every day to the old prince’s for news of him
Old Prince Bolkónski heard all the rumors current in the town from Mademoiselle Bourienne and had read the note to Princess Mary in which Natásha had broken off her engagement
He seemed in better spirits than usual and awaited his son with great impatience
Some days after Anatole’s departure Pierre received a note from Prince Andrew
Prince Andrew had received from his father Natásha’s note to Princess Mary breaking off her engagement (Mademoiselle Bourienne had purloined it from Princess Mary and given it to the old prince)
Prince Andrew had arrived in the evening and Pierre came to see him next morning
Pierre expected to find Prince Andrew in almost the same state as Natásha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room to hear him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about some intrigue going on in Petersburg
looking toward the door of the room where Prince Andrew was
evidently intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow
but with a fresh horizontal wrinkle between his brows
The conversation was about Speránski—the news of whose sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached Moscow
and by those who were unable to understand his aims
To judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on him all the blame of other men’s mistakes is very easy
After a few words to Pierre about the awful roads from the Polish frontier
whom he had brought from abroad to be his son’s tutor
Pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too familiar
but I am unable to follow in that gentleman’s footsteps
Pierre noticed her satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off
Looking at them Pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the Rostóvs
Till then he had reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her
I would this moment ask on my knees for your hand and your love
Pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom
restraining tears of tenderness and joy that choked him
Only looking up at the sky did Pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane things compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised
having traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable space
shining and displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars
reckoning those transporting and feeding the army—moved from the west eastwards to the Russian frontier
an event took place opposed to human reason and to human nature
and murders as in whole centuries are not recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world
to have taken proper pains and written a more adroit note
or for Napoleon to have written to Alexander:  My respected Brother
I consent to restore the duchy to the Duke of Oldenburg —and there would have been no war
We can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries
It naturally seemed to members of the English Parliament that the cause of the war was Napoleon’s ambition; to the Duke of Oldenburg
that the cause of the war was the violence done to him; to businessmen that the cause of the war was the Continental System which was ruining Europe; to the generals and old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of giving them employment; to the legitimists of that day that it was the need of re-establishing les bons principes
It is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of other reasons
the number depending on the endless diversity of points of view
presented themselves to the men of that day; but to us
To us it is incomprehensible that millions of Christian men killed and tortured each other either because Napoleon was ambitious or Alexander was firm
or because England’s policy was astute or the Duke of Oldenburg wronged
We cannot grasp what connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence: why because the Duke was wronged
who are not historians and are not carried away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event with unclouded common sense
an incalculable number of causes present themselves
The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events
there would have been so many less men in Napoleon’s army and the war could not have occurred
there would have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term then also there could have been no war
and had there not been an autocratic government in Russia
or a Revolution in France and a subsequent dictatorship and Empire
Without each of these causes nothing could have happened
for in order that the will of Napoleon and Alexander (on whom the event seemed to depend) should be carried out
the concurrence of innumerable circumstances was needed without anyone of which the event could not have taken place
It was necessary that millions of men in whose hands lay the real power—the soldiers who fired
or transported provisions and guns—should consent to carry out the will of these weak individuals
and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number of diverse and complex causes
We are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of irrational events (that is to say
events the reasonableness of which we do not understand)
The more we try to explain such events in history reasonably
and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain from doing this or that action; but as soon as he has done it
that action performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs to history
which is the more free the more abstract its interests
the more people he is connected with and the more power he has over others
was more convinced than ever that it depended on him
The people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men
the movement of troops into Prussia—undertaken (as it seemed to Napoleon) only for the purpose of securing an armed peace
All this is only the coincidence of conditions in which all vital organic and elemental events occur
And the botanist who finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so forth is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and says the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it
Equally right or wrong is he who says that Napoleon went to Moscow because he wanted to
and perished because Alexander desired his destruction
and he who says that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell because the last navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock
In historic events the so-called great men are labels giving names to events
is in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of history and predestined from eternity
CHAPTER II  On the twenty-ninth of May Napoleon left Dresden
tenderly embraced the Empress Marie Louise—who regarded him as her husband
though he had left another wife in Paris—left her grieved by the parting which she seemed hardly able to bear
Though the diplomatists still firmly believed in the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end
and sincerely assured him that he did not want war and would always love and honor him—yet he set off to join his army
the capital of a realm such as the Scythia into which Alexander the Great had marched—Napoleon unexpectedly
and the next day his army began to cross the Niemen
Early in the morning of the twelfth of June he came out of his tent
which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the Niemen
and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on the hill
they threw up their caps and shouted:  Vive l’Empereur
He mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the bridges over the Niemen
deafened continually by incessant and rapturous acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting
but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and distracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the time he joined the army
was heard in the ranks of the Polish Uhlans when one of the aides-de-camp rode up to them
he begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the Emperor’s eyes
It was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the stream
and the Uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their horses
Some of the horses were drowned and some of the men; the others tried to swim on
some in the saddle and some clinging to their horses’ manes
giving him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the drowning Uhlans who distracted his attention
The majority struggled back to the bank from which they had started
between issuing one order that the forged Russian paper money prepared for use in Russia should be delivered as quickly as possible and another that a Saxon should be shot
on whom a letter containing information about the orders to the French army had been found
The vacillation between the various plans that were proposed had even increased after the Emperor had been at headquarters for a month
Each of the three armies had its own commander in chief
but there was no supreme commander of all the forces
and the Emperor did not assume that responsibility himself
The longer the Emperor remained in Vílna the less did everybody—tired of waiting—prepare for the war
Connoisseurs of such matters declared that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place
Borís was now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his own age
He was meeting Hélène in Vílna after not having seen her for a long time and did not recall the past
Hardly had Balashëv begun to speak before a look of amazement appeared on the Emperor’s face
He took Balashëv by the arm and crossed the room with him
unconsciously clearing a path seven yards wide as the people on both sides made way for him
Borís noticed Arakchéev’s excited face when the sovereign went out with Balashëv
stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the Emperor to address him
(Borís understood that Arakchéev envied Balashëv and was displeased that evidently important news had reached the Emperor otherwise than through himself
All the time Borís was going through the figures of the mazurka
with the agitation of one who has been personally affronted
was finishing with these words:   To enter Russia without declaring war
I will not make peace as long as a single armed enemy remains in my country
It seemed to Borís that it gave the Emperor pleasure to utter these words
The Emperor re-entered the ballroom and remained there about another half-hour
was able to show certain important personages that much that was concealed from others was usually known to him
and by this means he rose higher in their estimation
and told him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to Field Marshal Prince Saltykóv
in which he insisted on the words being inserted that he would not make peace so long as a single armed Frenchman remained on Russian soil
that Your Majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me from the time Prince Kurákin asked for his passports
and as soon as I was informed of it I let him know how much I disapproved of it and ordered him to remain at his post
If Your Majesty does not intend to shed the blood of our peoples for such a misunderstanding
and consents to withdraw your troops from Russian territory
I shall see myself forced to repel an attack that nothing on my part has provoked
having sent for Balashëv and read him his letter to Napoleon
the Emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on Russian soil and told him to transmit those words to Napoleon
Alexander did not insert them in his letter to Napoleon
because with his characteristic tact he felt it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at reconciliation was being made
but he definitely instructed Balashëv to repeat them personally to Napoleon
The noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental matters without looking at the Russian general
After living at the seat of the highest authority and power
after conversing with the Emperor less than three hours before
and in general being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service
awaiting the arrival of an officer from the village
but with a shade of martial swagger in their clothes
and a touch of the gaiety and spirit of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign
The French colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn
but was polite and evidently understood Balashëv’s importance
The colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile and a quarter away and would receive Balashëv and conduct him to his destination
on a black horse with trappings that glittered in the sun
his plumes flowing and his gems and gold lace glittering in the bright June sunshine
and therefore assumed a more solemn and important air than formerly
after he had been ordered to return to military service—and especially since his last interview with Napoleon in Danzig
and—like a well-fed but not overfat horse that feels himself in harness and grows skittish between the shafts—he dressed up in clothes as variegated and expensive as possible
As soon as the King began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity instantly forsook him
and without noticing it he passed into his natural tone of good-natured familiarity
with the affectation unavoidable in frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a novelty
He referred to the fact that the Emperor Napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdraw his troops from Prussia
with all my heart I wish the Emperors may arrange the affair between them
in the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another despite a quarrel between their masters
And he went on to inquiries about the Grand Duke and the state of his health
however incongruous their presence and their proximity to the head of the government may be
This inevitability alone can explain how the cruel Arakchéev
who tore out a grenadier’s mustache with his own hands
but Marshal Davout was one of those men who purposely put themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for being gloomy
Davout allowed himself that pleasure when Balashëv was brought in
He became still more absorbed in his task when the Russian general entered
and after glancing over his spectacles at Balashëv’s face
When he noticed in Balashëv’s face the disagreeable impression this reception produced
Davout raised his head and coldly asked what he wanted
Thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because Davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the Emperor Alexander and even his envoy to Napoleon
as if to make the Russian general still more conscious of his dependence on brute force
Davout sent an adjutant to call the officer on duty
sentinels of the Preobrazhénsk regiment had stood in front of the house to which Balashëv was conducted
and now two French grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with shaggy caps on their heads
Napoleon received Balashëv in the very house in Vílna from which Alexander had dispatched him on his mission
CHAPTER VI  Though Balashëv was used to imperial pomp
he was amazed at the luxury and magnificence of Napoleon’s court
and Polish magnates—several of whom Balashëv had seen at the court of the Emperor of Russia—were waiting
opening in front over a white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach
but one lock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead
with a jerk at every step and his head slightly thrown back
He nodded in answer to Balashëv’s low and respectful bow
I have received the letter you brought from the Emperor Alexander and am very glad to see you
He glanced with his large eyes into Balashëv’s face and immediately looked past him
It was plain that Balashëv’s personality did not interest him at all
Evidently only what took place within his own mind interested him
Even now  (he emphasized the word)  I am ready to receive any explanations you can give me
And he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for dissatisfaction with the Russian government
Judging by the calmly moderate and amicable tone in which the French Emperor spoke
Balashëv added that the Emperor Alexander wished for peace
Here Balashëv hesitated: he remembered the words the Emperor Alexander had not written in his letter
He grew confused and said:  On condition that the French army retires beyond the Niemen
Napoleon noticed Balashëv’s embarrassment when uttering these last words; his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiver rhythmically
Instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from Pomerania
You say the demand now is that I am to withdraw beyond the Niemen before commencing negotiations
He went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again stopped in front of Balashëv
Balashëv noticed that his left leg was quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern expression
This quivering of his left leg was a thing Napoleon was conscious of
evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace and discuss its possibility
but only to prove his own rectitude and power and Alexander’s errors and duplicity
and the more he talked the less could he control his words
growing more and more excited as he paced up and down the room
and as soon as the latter tried to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him
Granted that were they competent they might be made use of
continued Napoleon—hardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts that incessantly sprang up
And what role is your young monarch playing in that monstrous crowd
They compromise him and throw on him the responsibility for all that happens
evidently uttering these words as a direct challenge to the Emperor
forgetting that his word of honor could carry no weight— I give you my word of honor that I have five hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the Vistula
The Turks will be of no use to you; they are worth nothing and have shown it by making peace with you
As for the Swedes—it is their fate to be governed by mad kings
Their king was insane and they changed him for another—Bernadotte
who promptly went mad—for no Swede would ally himself with Russia unless he were mad
Napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose
Balashëv knew how to reply to each of Napoleon’s remarks
Balashëv wished to reply that when Russia is on her side Sweden is practically an island: but Napoleon gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice
he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized Napoleon
He knew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon had any significance
And probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this obvious falsehood
gesticulating rapidly and energetically with his white hands
I will throw you back beyond the Dvína and beyond the Dnieper
still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to him
Everyone in the reception room rushed forward and descended the staircase
Balashëv felt convinced that Napoleon would not wish to see him
It was evident that he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a mistake
and that in his perception whatever he did was right
The Emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through Vílna
where crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him
Napoleon not only treated him amiably but behaved as if Balashëv were one of his own courtiers
one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at his success
In the course of conversation he mentioned Moscow and questioned Balashëv about the Russian capital
turning to Caulaincourt for appreciation of this remark
which hinted at the recent defeats of the French in Spain
was much appreciated when he related it at Alexander’s court
Balashëv involuntarily flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply
but hardly had he uttered the word Poltáva before Caulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from Petersburg to Moscow and of his Petersburg reminiscences
After dinner they went to drink coffee in Napoleon’s study
makes a man contented with himself and disposed to consider everyone his friend
Balashëv bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to make his bow and leave
and only listened because he could not help hearing what was said to him
Napoleon did not notice this expression; he treated Balashëv not as an envoy from his enemy
but as a man now fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former master’s humiliation
and simply as if he were doing something not merely important but pleasing to Balashëv
The letter taken by Balashëv was the last Napoleon sent to Alexander
but really to meet Anatole Kurágin whom he felt it necessary to encounter
On reaching Petersburg he inquired for Kurágin but the latter had already left the city
Pierre had warned his brother-in-law that Prince Andrew was on his track
his former commander who was always well disposed toward him
and Kutúzov suggested that he should accompany him to the army in Moldavia
Prince Andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge Kurágin
After his betrothed had broken faith with him—which he felt the more acutely the more he tried to conceal its effects—the surroundings in which he had been happy became trying to him
and the freedom and independence he had once prized so highly were still more so
Not only could he no longer think the thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the field of Austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with Pierre
and which had filled his solitude at Boguchárovo and then in Switzerland and Rome
but he even dreaded to recall them and the bright and boundless horizons they had revealed
He was now concerned only with the nearest practical matters unrelated to his past interests
Prince Andrew did not think it necessary to rush back to Russia after him
but all the same he knew that however long it might be before he met Kurágin
despite his contempt for him and despite all the proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping to a conflict with him—he knew that when he did meet him he would not be able to resist calling him out
any more than a ravenous man can help snatching at food
when news of the war with Napoleon reached Bucharest—where Kutúzov had been living for two months
who was already weary of Bolkónski’s activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness
and seen so much (having traveled both in the east and the west)
that on reaching Bald Hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail
The old prince had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth
which left a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth; in character he was the same as ever
quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just as the little princess used to do
the inner relations of all these people had changed since Prince Andrew had seen them last
The household was divided into two alien and hostile camps
During his stay at Bald Hills all the family dined together
but they were ill at ease and Prince Andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them all feel awkward
began to tell him of the young Count Kámensky’s campaign
the old prince began unexpectedly to talk about Princess Mary
The old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of Princess Mary: that she purposely worried and irritated him
and that by indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little Prince Nicholas
The old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her life was very hard
and Prince Andrew began telling him the story of Bluebeard
put him down from his knee and went out of the room
As soon as Prince Andrew had given up his daily occupations
and especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had been happy
weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity
When one thinks who and what—what trash—can cause people misery
he said with a malignity that alarmed Princess Mary
She looked a little above Prince Andrew’s head with the confident
and though till that moment he had not been thinking of Kurágin
saying that she knew how unhappy her father would be if Andrew left without being reconciled to him
but Prince Andrew replied that he would probably soon be back again from the army and would certainly write to his father
presented themselves one after another to Prince Andrew’s mind
occupied the fortified camp at Drissa; the second army was retreating
trying to effect a junction with the first one from which it was said to be cut off by large French forces
Everyone was dissatisfied with the general course of affairs in the Russian army
but no one anticipated any danger of invasion of the Russian provinces
As there was not a single town or large village in the vicinity of the camp
Barclay de Tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the Emperor
His mind was occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting a gigantic war
Prince Andrew rode round the whole fortified camp and
But the question whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous remained for him undecided
Already from his military experience and what he had seen in the Austrian campaign
tried to fathom the character of the control of the army and of the men and parties engaged in it
had with him not a commander in chief’s staff but the imperial headquarters staff
an adjutant general and Sardinian émigré; Wolzogen—and many others
or was given this or that advice and did not know whether a certain order received in the form of advice emanated from the man who gave it or from the Emperor and whether it had to be executed or not
But this was only the external condition; the essential significance of the presence of the Emperor and of all these people
It was this: the Emperor did not assume the title of commander in chief
but disposed of all the armies; the men around him were his assistants
Arakchéev was a faithful custodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereign’s bodyguard
useful as an adviser and ready at hand to replace Barclay
The Grand Duke was there because it suited him to be
The ex-Minister Stein was there because his advice was useful and the Emperor Alexander held him in high esteem personally
Paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech
The adjutants general were there because they always accompanied the Emperor
and lastly and chiefly Pfuel was there because he had drawn up the plan of campaign against Napoleon and
self-confident to the point of despising everyone else) was able to do
Besides these Russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected ideas every day—especially the foreigners
At that time a famous joke of Ermólov’s was being circulated
particularly against such a genius as Bonaparte (they called him Bonaparte now)
needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and in that respect Pfuel was a genius
yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third party
Of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the Tsarévich
expecting to crush the French gallantly; but unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid the general confusion
We have abandoned Vílna and Vítebsk and shall abandon Drissa
The fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of Barclay de Tolly
If Barclay is now to be superseded by Bennigsen all will be lost
but only the one most essential thing—as much advantage and pleasure for themselves as possible
In the troubled waters of conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the Emperor’s headquarters
it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at other times
merely to avoid responsibility or to please the Emperor
would declare that he had no opinion at all on the matter
beating his breast and challenging those who did not agree with him to duels
between two councils would simply solicit a special gratuity for his faithful services
well knowing that at that moment people would be too busy to refuse him
to achieve his long-cherished aim of dining with the Emperor
and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial favor
and directly they noticed it turning in any direction
this whole drone population of the army began blowing hard that way
without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme
which is in place at court but harmful in an army; that a sovereign should reign but not command the army
would be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence and authority of the monarch
the Secretary of State and one of the chief representatives of this party
availing himself of permission given him by the Emperor to discuss the general course of affairs
he respectfully suggested—on the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse a warlike spirit in the people of the capital—that the Emperor should leave the army
and that Prince Andrew was to present himself at Bennigsen’s quarters at six that evening
News was received at the Emperor’s quarters that very day of a fresh movement by Napoleon which might endanger the army—news subsequently found to be false
And that morning Colonel Michaud had ridden round the Drissa fortifications with the Emperor and had pointed out to him that this fortified camp constructed by Pfuel
received Bolkónski and informed him that the Emperor
accompanied by General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci
had gone a second time that day to inspect the fortifications of the Drissa camp
of the suitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felt
Chernýshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a French novel in his hand
This room had probably been a music room; there was still an organ in it on which some rugs were piled
and in one corner stood the folding bedstead of Bennigsen’s adjutant
not a military council (the Emperor preferred indefiniteness)
a council to elucidate certain questions for the Emperor personally
he addressed Chernýshev and asked in German where the Emperor was
He muttered something to himself abruptly and in a bass voice
remarking that Prince Andrew was just back from Turkey where the war had terminated so fortunately
Pfuel barely glanced—not so much at Prince Andrew as past him—and said
Pfuel was one of those hopelessly and immutably self-confident men
self-confident to the point of martyrdom as only Germans are
as being a citizen of the best-organized state in the world
and therefore as an Englishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as an Englishman is undoubtedly correct
An Italian is self-assured because he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people
A Russian is self-assured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know anything
He had a science—the theory of oblique movements deduced by him from the history of Frederick the Great’s wars
for the plan of campaign that ended in Jena and Auerstädt
Pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love their theory that they lose sight of the theory’s object—its practical application
for failures resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him the accuracy of his theory
He said a few words to Prince Andrew and Chernýshev about the present war
querulous sounds of his voice were at once heard from there
and Bennigsen had hastened on to make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign
into the drawing room where the council was assembled
He came out of the study into the drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table
and put questions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen present
unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position away from the Petersburg and Moscow roads
but he urged that at this point the army should unite and there await the enemy
Young Count Toll objected to the Swedish general’s views more warmly than anyone else
In these voluminous notes Toll suggested another scheme
could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap (as he called the Drissa camp) in which we were situated
General Armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with an exposed rear
like a mathematician who ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of a problem that has already been proved
and invoked his terrible name to shatter each other’s proposals
From the tone in which the courtiers addressed him and the way Paulucci had allowed himself to speak of him to the Emperor
And despite his self-confidence and grumpy German sarcasm he was pitiable
with his hair smoothly brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind
Though he concealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt
felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying
A thought that had long since and often occurred to him during his military activities—the idea that there is not and cannot be any science of war
and that therefore there can be no such thing as a military genius—now appeared to him an obvious truth
What theory and science is possible about a matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot be defined
especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot be ascertained
No one was or is able to foresee in what condition our or the enemy’s armies will be in a day’s time
and no one can gauge the force of this or that detachment
nothing can be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions
and Paulucci says we have got the French army between two fires; Michaud says that the worthlessness of the Drissa camp lies in having the river behind it
Is a man a genius who can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go to the right and who to the left
It is only because military men are invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter power
Not only does a good army commander not need any special qualities
It is understandable that a theory of their ‘genius’ was invented for them long ago because they have power
’ And only in the ranks can one serve with assurance of being useful
So thought Prince Andrew as he listened to the talking
and he roused himself only when Paulucci called him and everyone was leaving
At the review next day the Emperor asked Prince Andrew where he would like to serve
Nicholas did not even make any attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from the army
but wrote to his parents that he was sorry Natásha was ill and her engagement broken off
and the winter with the Christmas holidays and Sónya’s love
conscious of his advantageous position in the regiment
devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests of military service
though he knew that sooner or later he would have to relinquish them
the whole of this retreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplies was a very simple and agreeable business
If the thought that things looked bad chanced to enter anyone’s head
preparing for reviews and being reviewed by the Emperor and other high commanders
Then came an order to retreat to Sventsyáni and destroy any provisions they could not carry away with them
Sventsyáni was remembered by the hussars only as the drunken camp
a name the whole army gave to their encampment there
The two Pávlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye
a lad of sixteen who had recently joined the regiment
was now in the same relation to Nicholas that Nicholas had been to Denísov seven years before
spoke grandiloquently of the Saltánov dam being  a Russian Thermopylae
and of how a deed worthy of antiquity had been performed by General Raévski
He recounted how Raévski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and had charged with them beside him
Since the campaigns of Austerlitz and of 1807 Rostóv knew by experience that men always lie when describing military exploits
as he himself had done when recounting them; besides that
there must have been such a confusion and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if Raévski did lead his sons there
the rest could not have seen how or with whom Raévski came onto the dam
And even those who did see it would not have been much stimulated by it
Mary Hendríkhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor
whether from lack of means or because he did not like to part from his young wife in the early days of their marriage
Rostóv and Ilyín hastened to find a corner where they could change into dry clothes without offending Mary Hendríkhovna’s modesty
They were going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change
but found it completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the light of a solitary candle on an empty box
and these officers would on no account yield their position
One offered her a clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands
another spread a jacket under her little feet to keep them from the damp
another hung his coat over the window to keep out the draft
Even those playing cards behind the partition soon left their game and came over to the samovar
Rostóv took a pack of cards and proposed that they should play  Kings  with Mary Hendríkhovna
They drew lots to settle who should make up her set
At Rostóv’s suggestion it was agreed that whoever became  King  should have the right to kiss Mary Hendríkhovna’s hand
he scratched himself and asked to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way
but they did not sleep for a long time; now they exchanged remarks
recalling the doctor’s uneasiness and his wife’s delight
CHAPTER XIV  It was nearly three o’clock but no one was yet asleep
the officers began hurriedly getting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar
As they left the tavern in the twilight of the dawn
Rostóv and Ilyín both glanced under the wet and glistening leather hood of the doctor’s cart
from under the apron of which his feet were sticking out
Half an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road
defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch trees on each side
That curly grass which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible
swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one side
not because he had grown used to being under fire (one cannot grow used to danger)
but because he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger
handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him
He knew from experience the tormenting expectation of terror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time could help him
The whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it
Before Rostóv had had time to consider and determine the distance of that firing
Count Ostermann-Tolstóy’s adjutant came galloping from Vítebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road
The squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery—which had also quickened their pace—rode down a hill
passing along the line of troops on the left flank of our position
halted behind our Uhlans who were in the front line
Again all was silent and then again it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding them
he viewed the field of battle opening out before him from the hill
and five minutes later our Uhlans were galloping back
not to the place they had occupied but more to the left
was one of the first to catch sight of these blue French dragoons pursuing our Uhlans
Rostóv gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt
He saw the dragoons near and that they were galloping in disorder; he knew they could not withstand an attack—knew there was only that moment and that if he let it slip it would not return
Hardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their pace instinctively changed to a gallop
With the same feeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf
crouching on his gray horse and urging it on with his saber
and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he had vanquished
He hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the stirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from Rostóv’s face
felt sure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach of discipline
Ostermann’s flattering words and promise of a reward should therefore have struck him all the more pleasantly
Rostóv saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to have a look at his Frenchman with the dimple on his chin
He was sitting in his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about him
The sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound
George’s Cross and even given him a reputation for bravery
went to Moscow with Pétya and the rest of the household
and prescribed a great variety of medicines for all the diseases known to them
but a disease consisting of one of the innumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs
This simple thought could not occur to the doctors (as it cannot occur to a wizard that he is unable to work his charms) because the business of their lives was to cure
They satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in a child
when it wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt
The child cannot believe that the strongest and wisest of its people have no remedy for its pain
and the hope of relief and the expression of its mother’s sympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it
The doctors were of use to Natásha because they kissed and rubbed her bump
assuring her that it would soon pass if only the coachman went to the chemist’s in the Arbát and got a powder and some pills in a pretty box for a ruble and seventy kopeks
and all the other details of life ordered by the doctors
the carrying out of which supplied an occupation and consolation to the family circle
How would the count have borne his dearly loved daughter’s illness had he not known that it was costing him a thousand rubles
and that he would not grudge thousands more to benefit her
or had he not known that if her illness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and would take her abroad for consultations there
What would Sónya have done without the glad consciousness that she had not undressed during the first three nights
in order to be ready to carry out all the doctor’s injunctions with precision
and that she still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time when the slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be administered
Even to Natásha herself it was pleasant to see that so many sacrifices were being made for her sake
and to know that she had to take medicine at certain hours
he assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said that though there was danger
trying to conceal the action from herself and from him
slipped a gold coin into his hand and always returned to the patient with a more tranquil mind
The doctors said that she could not get on without medical treatment
so they kept her in the stifling atmosphere of the town
and the Rostóvs did not move to the country that summer of 1812
In spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders out of the little bottles and boxes of which Madame Schoss who was fond of such things made a large collection
tears at the recollection of those pure times which could never return
tears of vexation that she should so uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happy
and the Christmas holidays spent with Nicholas at Otrádnoe were what she recalled oftenest and most painfully
She kept away from everyone in the house and felt at ease only with her brother Pétya
and at the same time more seriously than did Count Bezúkhov
Natásha unconsciously felt this delicacy and so found great pleasure in his society
But she was not even grateful to him for it; nothing good on Pierre’s part seemed to her to be an effort
it seemed so natural for him to be kind to everyone that there was no merit in his kindness
Sometimes Natásha noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence
especially when he wanted to do something to please her
or feared that something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her
She noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and shyness
which she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was to her
After those involuntary words—that if he were free he would have asked on his knees for her hand and her love—uttered at a moment when she was so strongly agitated
came to Moscow to pay her devotions at the shrines of the Moscow saints
Despite the doctor’s orders that she should not go out early in the morning
Natásha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament
The countess was pleased with Natásha’s zeal; after the poor results of the medical treatment
in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayer might help her daughter more than medicines and
though not without fear and concealing it from the doctor
she agreed to Natásha’s wish and entrusted her to Belóva
went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn
There were never many people in the church; Natásha always stood beside Belóva in the customary place before an icon of the Blessed Virgin
gazing at the dark face of the Virgin illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning light falling from the window
she listened to the words of the service which she tried to follow with understanding
The prayers to which she surrendered herself most of all were those of repentance
for the first time for many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the life that lay before her
The doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue the powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously
looked down at her nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing room
And as up to the eleventh of July no manifesto or appeal had been received
exaggerated reports became current about them and about the position of Russia
passed through the crowd behind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them
wretched as she always was now when she found herself in a crowd
but this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to
but yet my best years are slipping by and are no good to anyone
condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner
She included among her enemies the creditors and all who had business dealings with her father
and always at the thought of enemies and those who hated her she remembered Anatole who had done her so much harm—and though he did not hate her she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy
Only at prayer did she feel able to think clearly and calmly of Prince Andrew and Anatole
as men for whom her feelings were as nothing compared with her awe and devotion to God
and at any rate loved the governing Synod and prayed for it
When he had finished the Litany the deacon crossed the stole over his breast and said
and placed it before the doors of the sanctuary screen
Everybody followed his example and they looked at one another in surprise
Hear us when we pray to Thee; strengthen with Thy might our most gracious sovereign lord
Take up the spear and shield and arise to help us; confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against us
may they be before the faces of Thy faithful warriors as dust before the wind
and may Thy mighty Angel confound them and put them to flight; may they be ensnared when they know it not
and in Thy great goodness and Thy many mercies regard not our transgressions and iniquities
arm us with unity of spirit in the righteous defense of the heritage Thou gavest to us and to our fathers
that those who hate us and our Orthodox faith may see it and be put to shame and perish
In Natásha’s receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her strongly
and she prayed to God with the tenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing
but without fully understanding what she was asking of God in that prayer
She shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousness
But she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled under foot when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more of them that she might pray for them
But neither could she doubt the righteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended knees
after leaving the Rostóvs’ with Natásha’s grateful look fresh in his mind
and did not ask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so transient and incomprehensible—but he remembered her as he had last seen her
and all his doubts vanished—not because she had answered the questions that had haunted him
drank as much and led the same idle and dissipated life
because besides the hours he spent at the Rostóvs’ there were other hours he had to spend somehow
He felt that the condition he was in could not continue long
that a catastrophe was coming which would change his whole life
and he impatiently sought everywhere for signs of that approaching catastrophe
Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six
written out with the same numerical values as the Hebrew
in which the first nine letters denote units and the others tens
by applying the same system to the words quarante-deux
which was the term allowed to the beast that  spoke great things and blasphemies
the same number 666 was obtained; from which it followed that the limit fixed for Napoleon’s power had come in the year 1812 when the French emperor was forty-two
and tried by the same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up
George’s Cross of the Fourth Class for courage shown in the Ostróvna affair
and in the same order the name of Prince Andrew Bolkónski
appointed to the command of a regiment of Chasseurs
Though he did not want to remind the Rostóvs of Bolkónski
Pierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news of their son’s having received a decoration
and the other orders to take with him when he went to dinner
His conversation with Count Rostopchín and the latter’s tone of anxious hurry
the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly things were going in the army
the rumors of the discovery of spies in Moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that Napoleon promised to be in both the Russian capitals by the autumn
But the chief reason for not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in the vague idea that he was L’russe Besuhof who had the number of the beast
666; that his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the power of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had been predestined from eternity
His coachman did not even ask whether he was to wait
He knew that when his master was at the Rostóvs’ he stayed till midnight
he had said that if he were not himself but the best man in the world and free
Just then Pétya came running in from the drawing room
Pétya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair
there’s to be an Extraordinary Meeting of the nobility
and of how some German fellow had been brought to Rostopchín and accused of being a French  spyer  (so Count Rostopchín had told the story)
Prince Golítsyn has engaged a master to teach him Russian
gazing with a searching look now at her father and now at Pierre
Pierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round
The countess shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression in the manifesto
or even the manifesto itself should no better pretext present itself
After reading about the dangers that threatened Russia
with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the attention that was being paid to her
both those now barring the enemy’s path and those freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear
May the ruin he hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head
as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose; and he added
Let the Emperor but say the word and we’ll sacrifice everything and begrudge nothing
Before Shinshín had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the count’s patriotism
who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son
They looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces
Pierre made up his mind not to go to the Rostóvs’ any more
CHAPTER XXI  After the definite refusal he had received
and several of the Rostóvs’ domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him
Pétya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the gentleman-in-waiting
It was on the very fact of being so young that Pétya counted for success in reaching the Emperor—he even thought how surprised everyone would be at his youthfulness—and yet in the arrangement of his collar and hair and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a grown-up man
But the farther he went and the more his attention was diverted by the ever-increasing crowds moving toward the Krémlin
the less he remembered to walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man
As he approached the Krémlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck out his elbows in a menacing way
Pétya tried to move forward in front of the others without waiting for all the carriages to pass
and also began working his elbows to such effect that he pushed Pétya into a very filthy corner of the gateway
and feared that if he were now to approach the gentlemen-in-waiting in that plight he would not be admitted to the Emperor
as if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else
But in spite of this he continued to struggle desperately forward
A tradesman’s wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl had cost; another was saying that all silk goods had now got dear
The clerk who had rescued Pétya was talking to a functionary about the priests who were officiating that day with the bishop
He sat on his elevation—the pedestal of the cannon—still agitated as before by the thought of the Emperor and by his love for him
still further intensified his sense of the importance of the occasion
and gentlemen-in-waiting came running out of the cathedral
and after them others in a more leisurely manner: caps were again raised
and those who had run to look at the cannon ran back again
whom he could not clearly see for the tears of joy that filled his eyes
and Pétya had not eaten anything and was drenched with perspiration
but he had to have a biscuit from the Tsar’s hand and he felt that he must not give way
In the first were the nobility and gentry in their uniforms
in the second bearded merchants in full-skirted coats of blue cloth and wearing medals
In the noblemen’s hall there was an incessant movement and buzz of voices
The chief magnates sat on high-backed chairs at a large table under the portrait of the Emperor
others again in the new uniforms of Alexander’s time or the ordinary uniform of the nobility
as on the faces of the crowd Pétya had seen in the Square
there was a striking contradiction: the general expectation of a solemn event
buttoned up since early morning in a nobleman’s uniform that had become too tight for him
He was agitated; this extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the merchant-class—les états généraux (States-General)—evoked in him a whole series of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply graven in his soul: thoughts of the Contrat Social and the French Revolution
The words that had struck him in the Emperor’s appeal—that the sovereign was coming to the capital for consultation with his people—strengthened this idea
And imagining that in this direction something important which he had long awaited was drawing near
he strolled about watching and listening to conversations
It was indicative of dissipation and the exercise of authority
If the noble awistocwacy of the pwovince of Moscow thinks fit
it can show its loyalty to our sov’weign the Empewah in other ways
Have we fo’gotten the waising of the militia in the yeah ‘seven
The nobility don’t gwudge theah lives—evewy one of us will go and bwing in more wecwuits
but not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say
that we have been summoned here not to discuss whether it’s best for the empire at the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia
We have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign the Emperor has honored us
that the Emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us merely owners of serfs whom we are willing to devote to his service
noticing the senator’s sarcastic smile and the freedom of Pierre’s remarks
But scarcely had Pierre uttered these words before he was attacked from three sides
The most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance
and whether as a result of the uniform or from some other cause Pierre saw before him quite a different man
that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years of age
We must cease raving if we are sons of our Fatherland
were less audible than the sound of his opponent’s voice
Count Rostóv at the back of the crowd was expressing approval; several persons
and then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall and to the big table
and people turned away from him as from a common enemy
This happened not because they were displeased by the substance of his speech
which had even been forgotten after the many subsequent speeches
at which sat gray-haired or bald seventy-year-old magnates
With an incessant hum of voices the crowd advanced to the table
Pressed by the throng against the high backs of the chairs
the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two together
Those standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastened to supply it
sat and turned to look first at one and then at another
but felt himself in some way to blame and wished to justify himself
CHAPTER XXIII  At that moment Count Rostopchín with his protruding chin and alert eyes
The Emperor has deigned to summon us and the merchants
a sudden cry resounded through the halls and the whole throng hurried to the entrance
Pierre stood rather far off and could not hear all that the Emperor said
From what he did hear he understood that the Emperor spoke of the danger threatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the Moscow nobility
There was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided
he had scarcely begun to address the merchants before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling voice
Pierre’s one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was ready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything
He now felt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and sought an opportunity of effacing it
Having heard that Count Mamónov was furnishing a regiment
Bezúkhov at once informed Rostopchín that he would give a thousand men and their maintenance
Old Rostóv could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears
The assembled nobles all took off their uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs
BOOK TEN: 1812      CHAPTER I  Napoleon began the war with Russia because he could not resist going to Dresden
could not help having his head turned by the homage he received
could not help donning a Polish uniform and yielding to the stimulating influence of a June morning
and could not refrain from bursts of anger in the presence of Kurákin and then of Balashëv
Alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally insulted
Barclay de Tolly tried to command the army in the best way
because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a great commander
their personal interests have vanished leaving no trace
nor still less any of those who did the actual fighting
the character given to the war by the burning of Russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused among the Russian people
But no one at the time foresaw (what now seems so evident) that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand men—the best in the world and led by the best general—could be destroyed in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength
despite Napoleon’s experience and so-called military genius
to doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destruction
In historical works on the year 1812 French writers are very fond of saying that Napoleon felt the danger of extending his line
that he sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at Smolénsk
and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign was even then understood
are advanced only because they fit in with the event
Had that event not occurred these hints would have been forgotten
as we have forgotten the thousands and millions of hints and expectations to the contrary which were current then but have now been forgotten because the event falsified them
There are always so many conjectures as to the issue of any event that however it may end there will always be people to say:  I said then that it would be so
quite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect
Conjectures as to Napoleon’s awareness of the danger of extending his line
All the facts are in flat contradiction to such conjectures
During the whole period of the war not only was there no wish on the Russian side to draw the French into the heart of the country
but from their first entry into Russia everything was done to stop them
And not only was Napoleon not afraid to extend his line
though uniting the armies was no advantage if we meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country
Our Emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of Russian soil and not to retreat
The Emperor reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired
He could not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach Smolénsk
still less could he contemplate the burning of Moscow
and the Russian commanders and people were still more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the depths of the country
Napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and missed several chances of forcing an engagement
In August he was at Smolénsk and thought only of how to advance farther
though as we now see that advance was evidently ruinous to him
The facts clearly show that Napoleon did not foresee the danger of the advance on Moscow
The luring of Napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plan
with the evident intention of giving battle and checking the enemy’s advance
and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle with a much stronger enemy
and necessarily withdrawing the armies at an acute angle—we led the French on to Smolénsk
But we withdrew at an acute angle not only because the French advanced between our two armies; the angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther
because Barclay de Tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by Bagratión (who would come under his command)
and Bagratión—being in command of the second army—tried to postpone joining up and coming under Barclay’s command as long as he could
and it was best for him to retire more to the left and more to the south
unexpectedly employed his energy to influence Alexander
and Pfuel’s whole plan was abandoned and the command entrusted to Barclay
and the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief
and as the most convenient and indeed the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in general to a patriotic war
And by this visit of the Emperor to Moscow the strength of the Russian army was trebled
He left in order not to obstruct the commander in chief’s undivided control of the army
and hoping that more decisive action would then be taken
feeling less free than ever under the observation of all these  eyes of the Emperor
Bagratión drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by Barclay
the Emperor’s confidant:  It must be as my sovereign pleases
but I cannot work with the Minister (meaning Barclay)
Headquarters are so full of Germans that a Russian cannot exist and there is no sense in anything
While disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of battle
and while we were looking for the French—having lost touch with them—the French stumbled upon Nevérovski’s division and reached the walls of Smolénsk
It was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at Smolénsk to save our lines of communication
The battle was fought and thousands were killed on both sides
Smolénsk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the Emperor and of the whole people
At the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former way of life
devoting himself with special activity to building operations and the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his relations with Mademoiselle Bourienne
or with  God’s folk  who sometimes came by the back door to see her
was horrified by and amazed at the strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another
though Dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was passionately interested in its progress and tried to explain his own conception of it to her
We in Moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored Emperor
You heard probably of the heroic exploit of Raévski
embracing his two sons and saying: ‘I will perish with them but we will not be shaken
and laughed at Dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner
The prince’s tone was so calm and confident that Princess Mary unhesitatingly believed him
All that July the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated
He planned another garden and began a new building for the domestic serfs
One day he would order his camp bed to be set up in the glass gallery
another day he remained on the couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without undressing
while—instead of Mademoiselle Bourienne—a serf boy read to him
In his first letter which came soon after he had left home
Prince Andrew had dutifully asked his father’s forgiveness for what he had allowed himself to say and begged to be restored to his favor
To this letter the old prince had replied affectionately
enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts as to the further progress of the war
In this letter Prince Andrew pointed out to his father the danger of staying at Bald Hills
These he put down beside him—not letting anyone read them at dinner
On moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to Princess Mary and
and not taking his eyes from the plan of the building
thought that what her father was saying was correct
and the prince after speaking to him about the building looked angrily at Princess Mary and Dessalles and went to his own room
and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscript—his  Remarks  as he termed it—which was to be transmitted to the Emperor after his death
The prince had a list of things to be bought in Smolénsk and
He paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes
bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to be of a special shape the prince had himself designed
and a leather case had to be ordered to keep the  will  in
but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing thoughts came to him in bed
but the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was better than other places: he had never slept there yet
Pressing his lips together he made that effort for the twenty-thousandth time and lay down
He put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes
and a burning sense of jealousy of  the favorite  agitated him now as strongly as it had done then
lay forty miles east from Smolénsk and two miles from the main road to Moscow
as the prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety
though from Prince Andrew’s letter it was evident that to remain at Bald Hills might be dangerous
he respectfully advised her to send a letter by Alpátych to the Provincial Governor at Smolénsk
asking him to let her know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which Bald Hills was exposed
Three well-fed roans stood ready harnessed to a small conveyance with a leather hood
The larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness stuffed with paper
muttered Alpátych to himself and started on his journey
and at other quite black fields just being plowed a second time
As he went along he looked with pleasure at the year’s splendid crop of corn
scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there were already being reaped
made his calculations as to the sowing and the harvest
he arrived at the town toward evening on the fourth of August
Alpátych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on the road
but in thinking about his own business he soon forgot it
Everything not connected with the execution of the prince’s orders did not interest and did not even exist for Alpátych
Next morning Alpátych donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on business
From beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning
At eight o’clock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of musketry
evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and questions addressed to him
he announced with such solemnity and significance that the official turned to him and took the letters
The paper handed to him by the Governor said this:   I assure you that the town of Smolénsk is not in the slightest danger as yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with any
I from the one side and Prince Bagratión from the other are marching to unite our forces before Smolénsk
which junction will be effected on the 22nd instant
and both armies with their united forces will defend our compatriots of the province entrusted to your care till our efforts shall have beaten back the enemies of our Fatherland
or till the last warrior in our valiant ranks has perished
From this you will see that you have a perfect right to reassure the inhabitants of Smolénsk
and cupboards kept emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets
Loaded carts stood at the house next to Ferapóntov’s and women were wailing and lamenting as they said good-by
A small watchdog ran round barking in front of the harnessed horses
with a baby in her arms and her kerchief torn from her head
Alpátych looked out of the window and went to the door
Suddenly the strange sound of a far-off whistling and thud was heard
followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull roar that set the windows rattling
He went out into the street: two men were running past toward the bridge
From different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town
But these sounds were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants
The town was being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which Napoleon had ordered up after four o’clock
The people did not at once realize the meaning of this bombardment
who till then had not ceased wailing under the shed
became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate
With lively curiosity everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew over their heads
now with the swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball
The mistress rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the cellar asked in a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband who had remained in the street
A shopman who entered told her that her husband had gone with others to the cathedral
Alpátych left the cellar and stopped in the doorway
On two sides black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires
Through the streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in different directions like ants from a ruined ant-hill
suddenly began to wail as they looked at the fires—the smoke and even the flames of which could be seen in the failing twilight—and as if in reply the same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of the street
Inside the shed Alpátych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and traces of their horses with trembling hands
As Alpátych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers in Ferapóntov’s open shop
Soldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking it completely
so that Alpátych could not pass out and had to wait
There were stars in the sky and the new moon shone out amid the smoke that screened it
On the sloping descent to the Dnieper Alpátych’s cart and that of the innkeeper’s wife
and through the incessant crackling of the flames talking and shouting could be heard
Seeing that his trap would not be able to move on for some time
Alpátych got down and turned into the side street to look at the fire
Soldiers were continually rushing backwards and forwards near it
Alpátych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which was blazing briskly
At that moment the flames flared up and showed his young master’s pale worn face
Prince Andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his knee began writing in pencil on a page he tore out
He wrote to his sister:   Smolénsk is being abandoned
Having written this and given the paper to Alpátych
Before he had had time to finish giving these instructions
Prince Andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking to Alpátych
So tell them that I shall await a reply till the tenth
The fire died down for a moment and wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof
echoing the crash of the collapsing roof of the barn
On the tenth of August the regiment Prince Andrew commanded was marching along the highroad past the avenue leading to Bald Hills
Heat and drought had continued for more than three weeks
Each day fleecy clouds floated across the sky and occasionally veiled the sun
Some of this dust was kneaded by the feet and wheels
and worst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that road
The higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust
and through the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked eye at the sun
They marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and mouths
The burning of Smolénsk and its abandonment made an epoch in his life
A novel feeling of anger against the foe made him forget his own sorrow
belonging to a different world and who could not know and understand his past
Everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to him
and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself to trying to do his duty and not to be unfair
In truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to Prince Andrew
especially after the abandonment of Smolénsk on the sixth of August (he considered that it could and should have been defended) and after his sick father had had to flee to Moscow
Prince Andrew had something to think about entirely apart from general questions
and sister had left for Moscow; and though there was nothing for him to do at Bald Hills
rode to his father’s estate where he had been born and spent his childhood
Riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens of women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden beetles
No one at the stone entrance gates of the drive and the door stood open
Grass had already begun to grow on the garden paths
and horses and calves were straying in the English park
Prince Andrew rode up to the hothouse; some of the glass panes were broken
Having gone round the corner of the hothouse to the ornamental garden
he saw that the carved garden fence was broken and branches of the plum trees had been torn off with the fruit
He was sitting on the seat the old prince used to like to sit on
he turned away and began to report on the position of affairs
Everything precious and valuable had been removed to Boguchárovo
of which Alpátych said there had been a remarkable crop that year
had been commandeered by the troops and mown down while still green
understanding the question to refer to their departure for Boguchárovo
take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the Ryazán estate or to the one near Moscow
the prince spurred his horse and rode down the avenue at a gallop
The old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden
like a fly impassive on the face of a loved one who is dead
the elder one with frightened look clutched her younger companion by the hand and hid with her behind a birch tree
he realized the existence of other human interests entirely aloof from his own and just as legitimate as those that occupied him
chirruping something in their shrill little voices and holding up their skirts
their bare little sunburned feet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow grass
Prince Andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dusty highroad along which the troops were moving
burned and scorched his back intolerably through his black coat
floundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering can
a dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy
and the men were in such haste to clear out that the prince could hardly stop them
not from cold but from a sense of disgust and horror he did not himself understand
aroused by the sight of that immense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond
On the seventh of August Prince Bagratión wrote as follows from his quarters at Mikháylovna on the Smolénsk road:  Dear Count Aléxis Andréevich—(He was writing to Arakchéev but knew that his letter would be read by the Emperor
and therefore weighed every word in it to the best of his ability
God forbid that you should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats
You would set all Russia against you and everyone of us would feel ashamed to wear the uniform
but as a general he is not merely bad but execrable
I am really frantic with vexation; forgive my writing boldly
For the Minister is leading these visitors after him to Moscow in a most masterly way
Only I am sorry for the Emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as he
Since the year 1805 we had made peace and had again quarreled with Bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade them again
but the salons of Anna Pávlovna and Hélène remained just as they had been—the one seven and the other five years before
At Anna Pávlovna’s they talked with perplexity of Bonaparte’s successes just as before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the European sovereigns a malicious conspiracy
In Anna Pávlovna’s circle only those Frenchmen were admitted who were deep-rooted legitimists
and only the reports most flattering to our army were circulated
In the French circle of Hélène and Rumyántsev the reports of the cruelty of the enemy and of the war were contradicted and all Napoleon’s attempts at conciliation were discussed
In that circle they discountenanced those who advised hurried preparations for a removal to Kazán of the court and the girls’ educational establishments under the patronage of the Dowager Empress
In Hélène’s circle the war in general was regarded as a series of formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace
and the view prevailed expressed by Bilíbin—who now in Petersburg was quite at home in Hélène’s house
which every clever man was obliged to visit—that not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be settled
He visited his  good friend Anna Pávlovna  as well as his daughter’s  diplomatic salon
and often in his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused and said at Hélène’s what he should have said at Anna Pávlovna’s and vice versa
Soon after the Emperor’s return Prince Vasíli in a conversation about the war at Anna Pávlovna’s severely condemned Barclay de Tolly
presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the Treasury
cautiously ventured to suggest that Kutúzov would be the man to satisfy all requirements
Anna Pávlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that Kutúzov had done nothing but cause the Emperor annoyance
This was quite correct on the twenty-fourth of July
and Kochubéy met to consider the progress of the war
This committee came to the conclusion that our failures were due to a want of unity in the command and though the members of the committee were aware of the Emperor’s dislike of Kutúzov
after a short deliberation they agreed to advise his appointment as commander in chief
That same day Kutúzov was appointed commander in chief with full powers over the armies and over the whole region occupied by them
On the ninth of August Prince Vasíli at Anna Pávlovna’s again met the  man of great merit
The latter was very attentive to Anna Pávlovna because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational establishments for young ladies
could not refrain from reminding Prince Vasíli of his former opinion
Though this was impolite to Prince Vasíli in Anna Pávlovna’s drawing room
wishing to flatter Anna Pávlovna by defending her former position on this question
observed:   It is said that the Emperor was reluctant to give Kutúzov those powers
They say he blushed like a girl to whom Joconde is read
And Prince Vasíli repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by Kutúzov to the Emperor
remarked the  man of great merit  who did not yet possess courtly tact
that his excellency made it an express condition that the sovereign himself should not be with the army
As soon as he said this both Prince Vasíli and Anna Pávlovna turned away from him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at his naïveté
trying to justify his hero says that he was drawn to the walls of Moscow against his will
A good chessplayer having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his loss resulted from a mistake he made and looks for that mistake in the opening
but forgets that at each stage of the game there were similar mistakes and that none of his moves were perfect
and where it is not one will that manipulates lifeless objects
but everything results from innumerable conflicts of various wills
for Napoleon’s plain appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an Oriental mind the presence of a monarch
having got drunk the day before and left his master dinnerless
had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of chickens
bare-faced lackeys who have seen all sorts of things
consider it necessary to do everything in a mean and cunning way
are ready to render any sort of service to their master
—without knowing why or how this bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end
Napoleon turned to Berthier and said he wished to see how the news that he was talking to the Emperor himself
understanding that this was done to perplex him and that Napoleon expected him to be frightened
his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across the steppes of the East
dreaming of the Moscow that so appealed to his imagination
and  the bird restored to its native fields  galloped to our outposts
inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that he meant to relate to his comrades
Rostóv was just mounting to go for a ride round the neighboring villages with Ilyín; he let Lavrúshka have another horse and took him along with him
CHAPTER VIII  Princess Mary was not in Moscow and out of danger as Prince Andrew supposed
After the return of Alpátych from Smolénsk the old prince suddenly seemed to awake as from a dream
He ordered the militiamen to be called up from the villages and armed
and wrote a letter to the commander in chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at Bald Hills to the last extremity and to defend it
leaving to the commander in chief’s discretion to take measures or not for the defense of Bald Hills
where one of Russia’s oldest generals would be captured or killed
alarmed by her father’s feverish and sleepless activity after his previous apathy
could not bring herself to leave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey him
She refused to go away and her father’s fury broke over her in a terrible storm
making it the object of her life to poison his existence
and he drove her from his study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same to him
order her to be carried away by force but only told her not to let him see her cheered Princess Mary
Princess Mary saw him walk out of the house in his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his armed peasants and domestic serfs
She sat by the window listening to his voice which reached her from the garden
A large crowd of militiamen and domestics were moving toward her
in the play of the sunlight that fell in small round spots through the shade of the lime-tree avenue
could not be sure what change there was in his face
All she could see was that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one of timidity and submission
bled him and said that the prince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side
Dessalles and the little prince had already left for Moscow
and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what was going on around him or not
The doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due to physical causes; but Princess Mary thought he wished to tell her something
and the fact that her presence always increased his restlessness confirmed her opinion
often watched him not with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find symptoms of the approach of the end
And what seemed still more terrible to her was that since her father’s illness began (perhaps even sooner
when she stayed with him expecting something to happen)
all the personal desires and hopes that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened
Thoughts that had not entered her mind for years—thoughts of a life free from the fear of her father
These were temptations of the devil and Princess Mary knew it
She felt that a different world had now taken possession of her—the life of a world of strenuous and free activity
The doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince; the provincial Marshal of the Nobility sent an official to Princess Mary to persuade her to get away as quickly as possible
and the head of the rural police having come to Boguchárovo urged the same thing
saying that the French were only some twenty-five miles away
that French proclamations were circulating in the villages
and it seemed to her that his mutterings were louder than usual and that they turned him over oftener
Princess Mary saw and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to him
She had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look she sometimes involuntarily fixed on him
She knew that her going in during the night at an unusual hour would irritate him
But never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losing him
She recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of his found an expression of his love of her
That sincerity which often comes with waking showed her clearly what chiefly concerned her about her father’s illness
She looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her
Straining all her faculties Princess Mary looked at him
Princess Mary could not quite make out what he had said
timid expression of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke
Having understood this Princess Mary sobbed still louder
and the doctor taking her arm led her out to the veranda
soothing her and trying to persuade her to prepare for her journey
love such as she thought she had never felt till that moment
She ran out sobbing into the garden and as far as the pond
she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne—who had remained at Boguchárovo and did not wish to leave it—coming toward her with a stranger
This was the Marshal of the Nobility of the district
who had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her prompt departure
not giving Dunyásha time to finish what she was saying
In the presence of Tíkhon and the doctor the women washed what had been the prince
tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth should not stiffen while open
and with another handkerchief tied together the legs that were already spreading apart
a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head
and in a corner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalms
Just as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse
bowed and kissed the old prince’s cold and stiffened hand
CHAPTER IX  Until Prince Andrew settled in Boguchárovo its owners had always been absentees
when he introduced hospitals and schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay
had not softened their disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in them the traits of character the old prince called boorishness
Various obscure rumors were always current among them: at one time a rumor that they would all be enrolled as Cossacks; at another of a new religion to which they were all to be converted; then of some proclamation of the Tsar’s and of an oath to the Tsar Paul in 1797 (in connection with which it was rumored that freedom had been granted them but the landowners had stopped it)
then of Peter Fëdorovich’s return to the throne in seven years’ time
when everything would be made free and so  simple  that there would be no restrictions
In the vicinity of Boguchárovo were large villages belonging to the crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where they pleased
There were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood and also very few domestic or literate serfs
and in the lives of the peasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of the Russian people
the causes and meaning of which are so baffling to contemporaries
and that contrary to what was happening in the Bald Hills district
where over a radius of forty miles all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villages to be devastated by the Cossacks
He learned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant Karp
who possessed great influence in the village commune and had recently been away driving a government transport
a proclamation by a French general that no harm would be done to the inhabitants
and if they remained they would be paid for anything taken from them
Alpátych learned that on the morning of the very day he gave the village Elder orders to collect carts to move the princess’ luggage from Boguchárovo
He had told her that after the sixteenth he could not be responsible for what might happen
for he received tidings that the French had unexpectedly advanced
and had barely time to remove his own family and valuables from his estate
whom the old prince called by the diminutive  Drónushka
Dron was made village Elder and overseer of Boguchárovo
and had since filled that post irreproachably for twenty-three years
and the steward respected him and jestingly called him  the Minister
During the whole time of his service Dron had never been drunk or ill
never after sleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the least fatigue
and though he could not read he had never forgotten a single money account or the number of quarters of flour in any of the endless cartloads he sold for the prince
Alpátych thought no difficulty would be made about complying with this order
for there were two hundred and thirty households at work in Boguchárovo and the peasants were well to do
possessing in the highest degree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts of those he dealt with
who had acquired property and was hated by the commune
must be hesitating between the two camps: the masters’ and the serfs’
withdrawing his hand from his bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at Dron’s feet
glanced furtively at Alpátych and again lowered his eyes
and the fact that he had been able to retain the old prince’s favor for twenty years had long since gained him the reputation of being a wizard
Alpátych had his own belongings taken out of the carts which had arrived from Bald Hills and had those horses got ready for the princess’ carriages
Meanwhile he went himself to the police authorities
CHAPTER X  After her father’s funeral Princess Mary shut herself up in her room and did not admit anyone
Princess Mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go away and begged to be left in peace
fingering the buttons of the leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion
and sinking into a chair she let her head fall on the window sill
All their former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind
But she remembered too how he had changed of late toward Mademoiselle Bourienne and could not bear to see her
but who yet was dependent on her and living in her house
She felt sorry for her and held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry
Mademoiselle Bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand
speaking of the princess’ sorrow and making herself a partner in it
She said her only consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her sorrow
to fall into the hands of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible
Mademoiselle Bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation (not printed on ordinary Russian paper) of General Rameau’s
appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the French
le Général Rameau would occupy Prince Andrew’s study and amuse himself by looking through and reading his letters and papers
the soldiers would violate my father’s newly dug grave to steal his crosses and stars
not thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father and her brother
For herself she did not care where she remained or what happened to her
but she felt herself the representative of her dead father and of Prince Andrew
Involuntarily she thought their thoughts and felt their feelings
entered the room and with a deep bow to Princess Mary came to a halt by the doorpost
What horses we had have been taken for the army or have died—this is such a year
She had heard vaguely that there was such a thing as  landlord’s corn  which was sometimes given to the peasants
She also knew that neither her father nor her brother would refuse to help the peasants in need
enabling her without scruple to forget her own grief
Princess Mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was asking to be discharged
She replied that she had never doubted his devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the peasants
CHAPTER XI  An hour later Dunyásha came to tell the princess that Dron had come
They probably think I am offering them the grain to bribe them to remain here
I ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near Moscow
And again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression
With drooping head Princess Mary left the crowd and went back to the house
Having repeated her order to Dron to have horses ready for her departure next morning
she went to her room and remained alone with her own thoughts
and stillness reigned over the village and the house
Pictures of the near past—her father’s illness and last moments—rose one after another to her memory
which she felt she could not contemplate even in imagination at this still and mystic hour of night
twitching his gray eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her
And she recalled in all its detail the night at Bald Hills before he had the last stroke
when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his will
She had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe
and going to the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened at the door
In a suffering and weary voice he was saying something to Tíkhon
Now he will never tell anyone what he had in his soul
Never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have said all he longed to say
It was sad and painful for him to talk to Tíkhon who did not understand him
And perhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that word to me
and in answer she saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief
and tearing herself out of this silence she ran to the servants’ quarters to meet her old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her
CHAPTER XIII  On the seventeenth of August Rostóv and Ilyín
and went for a ride—to try a new horse Ilyín had bought and to find out whether there was any hay to be had in the villages
For the last three days Boguchárovo had lain between the two hostile armies
a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls
Rostóv had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of that very Bolkónski who had been engaged to his sister
others stared at the new arrivals without doffing their caps
daughter of General in Chief Prince Nicholas Bolkónski who died on the fifteenth of this month
had actually had so bad an effect that Dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had not appeared when Alpátych sent for him; and that in the morning when the princess gave orders to harness for her journey
but was told (it was chiefly Karp who did the talking
but that if she stayed they would serve her as before and obey her in everything
exclaimed deeply moved voices as Rostóv passed through the anteroom
and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a man of her own class
she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and began speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion
What gentleness and nobility there are in her features and expression
thought he as he looked at her and listened to her timid story
as if fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity
Rostóv’s deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would consider himself happy to be acquainted with her
he did not wish to take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her
But on glancing at Rostóv’s face Ilyín stopped short
He saw that his hero and commander was following quite a different train of thought
kept pace with Rostóv at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views
He said the peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be imprudent to  overresist  them without an armed force
breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to vent it
And the nearer he drew to it the more Alpátych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results
After the hussars had come to the village and Rostóv had gone to see the princess
a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd
but as soon as he expressed it Karp and others attacked their ex-Elder
and at that moment several voices began speaking together
Alpátych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to come and bind Karp
and the crowd began at once to disperse through the village
Two hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the Boguchárovo house
he mounted and accompanied her eight miles from Boguchárovo to where the road was occupied by our troops
At the inn at Yankóvo he respectfully took leave of her
said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject
it seemed to her certain that had he not been there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the French
and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger to save her
When she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt her eyes filling with tears
Ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in love with a man who would perhaps never love her
And in all this Princess Mary saw the hand of Providence
It made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle Princess Mary
who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune
had against his will more than once entered his head
That was why Rostóv grew angry when he was rallied about Princess Bolkónskaya
CHAPTER XV  On receiving command of the armies Kutúzov remembered Prince Andrew and sent an order for him to report at headquarters
Prince Andrew arrived at Tsárevo-Zaymíshche on the very day and at the very hour that Kutúzov was reviewing the troops for the first time
He stopped in the village at the priest’s house in front of which stood the commander in chief’s carriage
inquired whether his Serene Highness was putting up there and whether he would soon be back
Prince Andrew knew Denísov from what Natásha had told him of her first suitor
and the recent news of his father’s death—and had experienced so many emotions
when after supper and after Natásha’s singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen without realizing what he was doing
He smiled at the recollection of that time and of his love for Natásha
and passed at once to what now interested him passionately and exclusively
This was a plan of campaign he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat
He had proposed that plan to Barclay de Tolly and now wished to propose it to Kutúzov
Denísov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to Bolkónski
mingling with music and songs and coming from the field where the review was held
at which a knot of soldiers (a guard of honor) was standing
and the familiar weariness of his expression were still the same
He was wearing the white Horse Guard’s cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging over his shoulder by a thin strap
and he stepped onto the porch which creaked under his weight
When he released him Prince Andrew saw that Kutúzov’s flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes
time-worn face) and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the enemy’s lines of communication between Smolénsk and Vyázma
stay here at the staff and tomorrow we’ll have a talk
the plans must be examined and several papers have to be signed
An adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness within
Prince Andrew heard the whisper of a woman’s voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door
handsome woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head
holding a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief
Kutúzov’s adjutant whispered to Prince Andrew that this was the wife of the priest whose home it was
and that she intended to offer his Serene Highness bread and salt
He was listening to the general’s report—which consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at Tsárevo-Zaymíshche—as he had listened to Denísov
and seven years previously had listened to the discussion at the Austerlitz council of war
as one has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer
All that Denísov had said was clever and to the point
What the general was saying was even more clever and to the point
but it was evident that Kutúzov despised knowledge and cleverness
and knew of something else that would decide the matter—something independent of cleverness and knowledge
Prince Andrew watched the commander in chief’s face attentively
and the only expression he could see there was one of boredom
or knowledge—he did not try to display any of these—but because of something else
He despised them because of his old age and experience of life
The only instruction Kutúzov gave of his own accord during that report referred to looting by the Russian troops
said Kutúzov as he signed the last of the documents
and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the room
The adjutant came out to the porch and asked Prince Andrew to lunch with him
Prince Andrew told Kutúzov all he knew of his father’s death
and again Prince Andrew noticed tears in the old man’s eyes
Though Prince Andrew knew that Kutúzov’s tears came easily
and that he was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to show sympathy with his loss
Prince Andrew could not have explained how or why it was
but after that interview with Kutúzov he went back to his regiment reassured as to the general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been entrusted
The more he realized the absence of all personal motive in that old man—in whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions
He will not hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful
despite the novel by Genlis and the French proverbs
and because his voice shook when he said: ‘What they have brought us to
and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor
hard to believe that Russia was really in danger and that the members of the English Club were also sons of the Fatherland ready to sacrifice everything for it
The one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had displayed during the Emperor’s stay was the call for contributions of men and money
the Moscovites’ view of their situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even more frivolous
as always happens with people who see a great danger approaching
says that it is too depressing and painful to think of the danger
since it is not in man’s power to foresee everything and avert the general course of events
They are all dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork
Others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar
It was said that Rostopchín had expelled all Frenchmen and even all foreigners from Moscow
There was talk of all the government offices having been already removed from Moscow
and to this Shinshín’s witticism was added—that for that alone Moscow ought to be grateful to Napoleon
she said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman
The latter in Pierre’s presence had ceased to be caustic
besides I am afraid I should hardly be able to climb onto a horse
He joined Obolénski’s Cossacks and went to Bélaya Tsérkov where the regiment is being formed
but the countess won’t on any account leave Moscow till her son returns
I have not taken on myself the role of Natalie Rostóva’s knight at all
CHAPTER XVIII  When Pierre returned home he was handed two of Rostopchín’s broadsheets that had been brought that day
ran the broadsheet  but I will stake my life on it that that scoundrel will not enter Moscow
These words showed Pierre clearly for the first time that the French would enter Moscow
said Pierre in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her
and Pierre’s head steward came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment of his regiment could not be found without selling one of the estates
but Pierre learned that it was being constructed by the Emperor’s desire
The Emperor had written to Count Rostopchín as follows:  As soon as Leppich is ready
Please impress upon Leppich to be very careful where he descends for the first time
that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemy’s hands
At the sight of the tortured Frenchman and the crowd surrounding the Lóbnoe Place
Pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no longer remain in Moscow and would leave for the army that very day that it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the man ought to have known it for himself
so on Evstáfey’s representation Pierre had to put off his departure till next day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance
He was told that there in Perkhúshkovo the earth trembled from the firing
Every house in Mozháysk had soldiers quartered in it
and the farther he left Moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and joyful feeling he had not experienced before
It was a feeling akin to what he had felt at the Slobóda Palace during the Emperor’s visit—a sense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing something
and he did not try to determine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight in sacrificing everything
He was not occupied with the question of what to sacrifice for; the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and joyous sensation
CHAPTER XIX  On the twenty-fourth of August the battle of the Shevárdino Redoubt was fought
on the twenty-fifth not a shot was fired by either side
and on the twenty-sixth the battle of Borodinó itself took place
but when I have exchanged thirteen more men he will be three times as strong as I am
Before the battle of Borodinó our strength in proportion to the French was about as five to six
but after that battle it was little more than one to two: previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and twenty thousand; afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a hundred thousand
losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of communication still more
and knew that the occupation of Moscow would not be the end of the campaign
for he had seen at Smolénsk the state in which Russian towns were left to him
the historians provided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of the generals who
of all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved and involuntary
The ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish the whole interest of the story
as anyone who cares to look into the matter can easily convince himself
during the retreat passed many positions better than Borodinó
They did not stop at any one of these positions because Kutúzov did not wish to occupy a position he had not himself chosen
because the popular demand for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough
The fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger
was no more a position than any other spot one might find in the Russian Empire by sticking a pin into the map at hazard
That redoubt was quite senseless in front of the position where the battle was accepted
Why was it more strongly fortified than any other post
And why were all efforts exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at night on the twenty-fourth
when reports on the battle of Borodinó were written at leisure
that the incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented (probably to justify the mistakes of a commander in chief who had to be represented as infallible) that the Shevárdino Redoubt was an advanced post—whereas in reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flank—and that the battle of Borodinó was fought by us on an entrenched position previously selected
whereas it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which was almost unentrenched
and the center at Borodinó at the confluence of the rivers Kolochá and Vóyna
did not see (as the history books say he did) the position of the Russians from Utítsa to Borodinó (he could not have seen that position because it did not exist)
nor did he see an advanced post of the Russian army
withdrew their left wing from the position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which had not been foreseen and was not fortified
By crossing to the other side of the Kolochá to the left of the highroad
and Borodinó—a plain no more advantageous as a position than any other plain in Russia—and there the whole battle of the twenty-sixth of August took place
Had Napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty-fourth to the Kolochá
and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt but had begun the attack next morning
no one would have doubted that the Shevárdino Redoubt was the left flank of our position
and the battle would have taken place where we expected it
In that case we should probably have defended the Shevárdino Redoubt—our left flank—still more obstinately
We should have attacked Napoleon in the center or on the right
to begin a general engagement then on the evening of the twenty-fourth
the first and chief action of the battle of Borodinó was already lost on the twenty-fourth
we found ourselves on the morning of the twenty-fifth without a position for our left flank
and were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to be
but the disadvantage of that position was increased by the fact that the Russian commanders—not having fully realized what had happened
namely the loss of our position on the left flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from right to left—maintained their extended position from the village of Nóvoe to Utítsa
and consequently had to move their forces from right to left during the battle
were actions distinct from the main course of the battle
So the battle of Borodinó did not take place at all as (in an effort to conceal our commanders’ mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the Russian army and people) it has been described
the Russians fought the battle of Borodinó on an open and almost unentrenched position
with forces only half as numerous as the French; that is to say
under conditions in which it was not merely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive result
but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete disintegration and flight
down which a winding road led out of the town past the cathedral on the right
where a service was being held and the bells were ringing
Pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on foot
Behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by its singers
in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying or sitting
childlike curiosity at Pierre’s white hat and green swallow-tail coat
being pressed against the side of the cutting in which the road ran
The sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into the cutting and there it was cold and damp
but above Pierre’s head was the bright August sunshine and the bells sounded merrily
placed a stone under one of its tireless hind wheels
an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following the cart on foot
Pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question
in which two wounded men were sitting and one was lying
One of those sitting up in the cart had probably been wounded in the cheek
The third lay prone so that his face was not visible
As if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment
In spite of the obscurity of the soldier’s words Pierre understood what he wanted to say and nodded approval
The road was clear again; Pierre descended the hill and drove on
He kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces
but only saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of different branches of the service
who all looked with astonishment at his white hat and green tail coat
But the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig
who had stared with merry surprise at his hat (perhaps the very men he had noticed)
twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death amazed Pierre
They may die tomorrow; why are they thinking of anything but death
and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind
When he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street
who were evidently still amused by the novelty of their position as soldiers
Pierre once more thought of the wounded men at Mozháysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said:  They want the whole nation to fall on them
impressed Pierre more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment than anything he had yet seen or heard
Beyond Valúevo the road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon
Far in the distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road
smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite masses of troops—ours and the enemy’s
The ground to the right—along the course of the Kolochá and Moskvá rivers—was broken and hilly
Between the hollows the villages of Bezúbova and Zakhárino showed in the distance
All that Pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations
and streams; and try as he would he could descry no military  position  in this place which teemed with life
The officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left beyond the river
Pierre pointed to another knoll in the distance with a big tree on it
Our right flank is over there —he pointed sharply to the right
and militiamen began running forward along the road
A church procession was coming up the hill from Borodinó
both those who had been in the village and those who had been at work on the battery
threw down their spades and ran to meet the church procession
George’s Cross on his neck stood just behind the priest’s back
and without crossing himself (he was evidently a German) patiently awaited the end of the service
which he considered it necessary to hear to the end
Pierre recognized several acquaintances among these notables
who were singing the service for the twentieth time that day
and the priest and deacon chimed in:  For to Thee under God we all flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection
there again kindled in all those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity of the impending moment that Pierre had seen on the faces at the foot of the hill at Mozháysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had met that morning; and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back
and sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard
who had been riding round the position and on his way back to Tatárinova had stopped where the service was being held
who attracted the attention of all the superior officers
kissed the icon as a child does with naïvely pouting lips
with a slightly martial touch appropriate to a campaign
He wore a long coat and like Kutúzov had a whip slung across his shoulder
Meanwhile Kutúzov had reached the village and seated himself in the shade of the nearest house
I was just trying to explain our position to the count
Though Kutúzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff
considered young Prince Drubetskóy an invaluable man
could so create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and that Bennigsen managed everything
Now the decisive moment of battle had come when Kutúzov would be destroyed and the power pass to Bennigsen
or even if Kutúzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by Bennigsen
was occupied by the different expression he saw on other faces—an expression that spoke not of personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death
Pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to Kutúzov
Borís evidently said this to Pierre in order to be overheard by his Serene Highness
regardless of the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn tone
On the eve of a day when God alone knows who of us is fated to survive
the officer had pointed out as being the center of our position and where rows of fragrant new-mown hay lay by the riverside
across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by hail
following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows of the plowed land
At the flèches Bennigsen stopped and began looking at the Shevárdino Redoubt opposite
which had been ours the day before and where several horsemen could be descried
The officers said that either Napoleon or Murat was there
trying to guess which of the scarcely discernible figures was Napoleon
straining each faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle
and only when several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappear in the thicket
One in particular declared with martial heat that they were put there to be slaughtered
Bennigsen on his own authority ordered the troops to occupy the high ground
This disposition on the left flank increased Pierre’s doubt of his own capacity to understand military matters
that they should not be seen and might be able to strike an approaching enemy unexpectedly
and some bushes near which rose the smoke of campfires—the soldiers’ kitchens
Narrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed to him
Prince Andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable as he had done seven years before at Austerlitz
and therefore most terrible thoughts—would give him no peace
He knew that tomorrow’s battle would be the most terrible of all he had taken part in
All life appeared to him like magic-lantern pictures at which he had long been gazing by artificial light through a glass
the Fatherland itself—how important these pictures appeared to me
and crude in the cold white light of this morning which I feel is dawning for me
I believed in some ideal love which was to keep her faithful to me for the whole year of my absence
perhaps not even by a Frenchman but by one of our own men
by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as one of them did yesterday
He looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine
but now from lack of officers a battalion commander
Prince Andrew looked out of the shed and saw Pierre
In our regiment two officers were court-martialed for that kind of thing
It is very sound: one can’t permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to marauding
a foreigner could serve her and be a splendid minister; but as soon as she is in danger she needs one of her own kin
while in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes weaker than a company
but instead of that I have the honor to serve here in the regiment with these gentlemen
who looked at his commander in alarm and bewilderment
In contrast to his former reticent taciturnity Prince Andrew now seemed excited
He could apparently not refrain from expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him
And we said so because we had nothing to fight for there
To them it is only a moment affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross or ribbon
For me tomorrow means this: a Russian army of a hundred thousand and a French army of a hundred thousand have met to fight
and the thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and the side that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win
After they had gone Pierre approached Prince Andrew and was about to start a conversation when they heard the clatter of three horses’ hoofs on the road not far from the shed
That’s what I was saying to you—those German gentlemen won’t win the battle tomorrow but will only make all the mess they can
The French have destroyed my home and are on their way to destroy Moscow
The question that had perturbed Pierre on the Mozháysk hill and all that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved
He understood that latent heat (as they say in physics) of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen
and worst of all they kill my children and my father
who had thought it was all the same to him whether or not Moscow was taken as Smolénsk had been
And then the determination of the troops would be quite different
Then all these Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow him into Russia
and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia without knowing why
War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life; and we ought to understand that and not play at war
We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously
to murder one another; they kill and maim tens of thousands
and Pierre could not make out whether the expression of Prince Andrew’s face was angry or tender
Natásha with animated and excited face was telling him how she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had lost her way in the big forest
Prince Andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him
de Beausset ordered a box he had brought for the Emperor to be carried before him and entered the first compartment of Napoleon’s tent
remained at the entrance talking to some generals of his acquaintance
was sprinkling Eau de Cologne on the Emperor’s pampered body with an expression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much Eau de Cologne should be sprinkled
who had entered the bedroom to report to the Emperor the number of prisoners taken in yesterday’s action
and wearing the blue uniform of the Guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room
But Napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpected rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprise
Napoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they were not ready
He did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him a surprise
so he pretended not to see de Beausset and called Fabvier to him
Napoleon made ironic remarks during Fabvier’s account
But though Napoleon knew that de Beausset had to say something of this kind
noticing that all the courtiers were looking at something concealed under a cloth
of the son borne to Napoleon by the daughter of the Emperor of Austria
the boy whom for some reason everyone called  The King of Rome
A very pretty curly-headed boy with a look of the Christ in the Sistine Madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball
The ball represented the terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter
With the natural capacity of an Italian for changing the expression of his face at will
he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look of pensive tenderness
He felt that what he now said and did would be historical
Let our remotest posterity recall your achievements this day with pride
replied de Beausset to the invitation to accompany the Emperor; he wanted to sleep
The original line of the Russian forces along the river Kolochá had been dislocated by the capture of the Shevárdino Redoubt on the twenty-fourth
and part of the line—the left flank—had been drawn back
It would seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion
nor any particular care or trouble on the part of the Emperor and his marshals
though the so-called Duke of Elchingen (Ney) ventured to remark that a movement through the woods was dangerous and might disorder the division
Having inspected the country opposite the Shevárdino Redoubt
After giving these and other commands he returned to his tent
of which the French historians write with enthusiasm and other historians with profound respect
were as follows:  At dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the plain occupied by the Prince d’Eckmühl will open fire on the opposing batteries of the enemy
on the flanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on the left
which will have forty guns in all directed against it
General Sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all the howitzers of the Guard’s artillery against either one or other of the entrenchments
During the cannonade Prince Poniatowski is to advance through the wood on the village and turn the enemy’s position
orders will be given in accordance with the enemy’s movements
The cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of the right wing are heard
The sharpshooters of Morand’s division and of the vice-King’s division will open a heavy fire on seeing the attack commence on the right wing
The vice-King will occupy the village and cross by its three bridges
advancing to the same heights as Morand’s and Gibrard’s divisions
which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces
which are very obscure and confused if one allows oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius
In the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the spot chosen by Napoleon
as from the spots selected by Napoleon the projectiles did not carry to the Russian works
and could not and did not turn the Russian position
The third order was: General Campan will move through the wood to seize the first fortification
General Campan’s division did not seize the first fortification but was driven back
The fourth order was: The vice-King will occupy the village (Borodinó) and cross by its three bridges
advancing to the same heights as Morand’s and Gérard’s divisions (for whose movements no directions are given)
not so much from this unintelligible sentence as from the attempts the vice-King made to execute the orders given him
After passing through Borodinó the vice-King was driven back to the Kolochá and could get no farther; while the divisions of Morand and Gérard did not take the redoubt but were driven back
orders will be given in accordance with the enemy’s movements
he could not know the course of the battle and not one of his orders during the fight could be executed
CHAPTER XXVIII  Many historians say that the French did not win the battle of Borodinó because Napoleon had a cold
and that if he had not had a cold the orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more full of genius and Russia would have been lost and the face of the world have been changed
To historians who believe that Russia was shaped by the will of one man—Peter the Great—and that France from a republic became an empire and French armies went to Russia at the will of one man—Napoleon—to say that Russia remained a power because Napoleon had a bad cold on the twenty-fourth of August may seem logical and convincing
If it had depended on Napoleon’s will to fight or not to fight the battle of Borodinó
and if this or that other arrangement depended on his will
then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will might have saved Russia
and consequently the valet who omitted to bring Napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth would have been the savior of Russia
Along that line of thought such a deduction is indubitable
as indubitable as the deduction Voltaire made in jest (without knowing what he was jesting at) when he saw that the Massacre of St
Bartholomew was due to Charles IX’s stomach being deranged
that the course of human events is predetermined from on high—depends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in the events
and that a Napoleon’s influence on the course of these events is purely external and fictitious
though he gave the order for it and thought it was done as a result of that order; and strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand men at Borodinó was not due to Napoleon’s will
though he ordered the commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done because he ordered it; strange as these suppositions appear
yet human dignity—which tells me that each of us is
felt at the sight of an army blocking their road to Moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk
Had Napoleon then forbidden them to fight the Russians
they would have killed him and have proceeded to fight the Russians because it was inevitable
in order to get food and rest as conquerors in Moscow
So it was not because of Napoleon’s commands that they killed their fellow men
And it was not Napoleon who directed the course of the battle
for none of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what was going on before him
So the way in which these people killed one another was not decided by Napoleon’s will but occurred independently of him
in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took part in the common action
It only seemed to Napoleon that it all took place by his will
the assertion made by various writers that his cold was the cause of his dispositions not being as well-planned as on former occasions
than previous dispositions by which he had won victories
These dispositions and orders only seem worse than previous ones because the battle of Borodinó was the first Napoleon did not win
The profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders seem very bad
and the very worst dispositions and orders seem very good
The dispositions drawn up by Weyrother for the battle of Austerlitz were a model of perfection for that kind of composition
did not get frightened or run away from the field of battle
he began to talk to him about Paris and about some changes he meant to make in the Empress’ household
self-confident surgeon who knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on his apron while a patient is being strapped to the operating table
The matter is in my hands and is clear and definite in my head
He was so much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep
and in spite of his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of the evening
He was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning
It was impossible to give further orders for the sake of killing time
for the orders had all been given and were now being executed
Rapp replied that he had given the Emperor’s order about the rice
They talk about medicine—what is the good of medicine when it can’t cure a cold
Let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself
it will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies
the campfires were dimly burning among the French Guards
and as he was passing a tall guardsman in a shaggy cap
The abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the faint morning light
then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the right
The first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another
CHAPTER XXX  On returning to Górki after having seen Prince Andrew
Pierre ordered his groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the morning
and then immediately fell asleep behind a partition in a corner Borís had given up to him
Before he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already left the hut
he kept repeating pertinaciously while he shook Pierre by the shoulder without looking at him
members of the staff could be heard conversing in French
He was looking through a field glass down the highroad before him
It was the same panorama he had admired from that spot the day before
The forest at the farthest extremity of the panorama seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowish-green color; its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and was pierced beyond Valúevo by the Smolénsk highroad crowded with troops
and unexpected; but what impressed Pierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself
so along the entire line outside and above it and especially in the woods and fields to the left
in the valleys and on the summits of the high ground
The general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought him
and turning out his toes pressed his heels against its sides and
causing the staff officers to smile as they watched him from the knoll
galloped in among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him
all with the same preoccupied expression and busy with some unseen but evidently important task
They all gazed with the same dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white hat
bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse
Without being aware of it he had come to the bridge across the Kolochá between Górki and Borodinó
which the French (having occupied Borodinó) were attacking in the first phase of the battle
Pierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that soldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadow
among the rows of new-mown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the smoke of the campfires the day before; but despite the incessant firing going on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle
did not see the enemy on the other side of the river
It was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being carried on stretchers
On that very meadow he had ridden over the day before
a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay
Pierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the adjutant to Raévski’s Redoubt
and only much later did Pierre learn that he lost an arm that day
Within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being fired through openings in the earthwork
When ascending that knoll Pierre had no notion that this spot
Pierre sat down at one end of a trench surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with an unconsciously happy smile
Occasionally he rose and walked about the battery still with that same smile
and continually running past him with bags and charges
In contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in support
here in the battery where a small number of men busy at their work were separated from the rest by a trench
everyone experienced a common and as it were family feeling of animation
The intrusion of Pierre’s nonmilitary figure in a white hat made an unpleasant impression at first
quite a boy still and evidently only just out of the Cadet College
The soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at Pierre
But when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat was doing no harm
paced up and down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard
cried the young officer to the men gathered round Pierre
The young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first or second time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men with great precision and formality
The booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more intense over the whole field
especially to the left where Bagratión’s flèches were
his whole attention was engrossed by watching the family circle—separated from all else—formed by the men in the battery
His first unconscious feeling of joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield was now replaced by another
By ten o’clock some twenty men had already been carried away from the battery; two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around
chaffing a peasant who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over
the lightning of hidden fire growing more and more intense glowed in the faces of these men
Pierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to know what was happening there; he was entirely absorbed in watching this fire which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the same way in his own soul
At ten o’clock the infantry that had been among the bushes in front of the battery and along the Kámenka streamlet retreated
After this from amid the ranks of infantry to the right of the battery came the sound of a drum and shouts of command
and from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantry moved forward
was walking backwards and kept glancing uneasily around
The ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their long-drawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard
A few minutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcher-bearers came back from that direction
Projectiles began to fall still more frequently in the battery
Several men were lying about who had not been removed
A cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was standing
crumbling down the earth; a black ball flashed before his eyes and at the same instant plumped into something
The officer’s face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered under his frowning brow
Suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground
When he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on his hands; the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed
CHAPTER XXXII  Beside himself with terror Pierre jumped up and ran back to the battery
as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him
He saw the senior officer lying on the earth wall with his back turned as if he were examining something down below and that one of the soldiers he had noticed before was struggling forward shouting  Brothers
and that another man had been bayoneted in the back before his eyes
Without further thought as to who had taken whom prisoner
(This was the attack for which Ermólov claimed the credit
declaring that only his courage and good luck made such a feat possible: it was the attack in which he was said to have thrown some St
pursued them so far beyond the battery that it was difficult to call them back
Pierre again went up onto the knoll where he had spent over an hour
aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers moving from the battlefield
the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible from both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way
while Murat’s troops advanced on Borodinó from their left
From the Shevárdino Redoubt where Napoleon was standing the flèches were two thirds of a mile away
and it was more than a mile as the crow flies to Borodinó
so that Napoleon could not see what was happening there
especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality
the smoke of the guns and musketry on the flèches grew so dense that it covered the whole approach on that side of it
could not be discovered from the Shevárdino Redoubt
But not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from where he was standing down below
or from the knoll above on which some of his generals had taken their stand
or maddened—even at those flèches themselves it was impossible to make out what was taking place
both because it was impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place of conflict but reported what they had heard from others; and also because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to Napoleon circumstances changed and the news he brought was already becoming false
Thus an adjutant galloped up from Murat with tidings that Borodinó had been occupied and the bridge over the Kolochá was in the hands of the French
The adjutant asked whether Napoleon wished the troops to cross it
Napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up on the farther side and wait
But before that order was given—almost as soon in fact as the adjutant had left Borodinó—the bridge had been retaken by the Russians and burned
in the very skirmish at which Pierre had been present at the beginning of the battle
and Davout killed; yet at the very time the adjutant had been told that the French had been repulsed
On the basis of these necessarily untrustworthy reports Napoleon gave his orders
did not take part in the actual fighting and only occasionally went within musket range
For the most part things happened contrary to their orders
and the cavalry dashed without orders in pursuit of the flying Russians
They did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling orders or for acting on their own initiative
for in battle what is at stake is what is dearest to man—his own life—and it sometimes seems that safety lies in running back
all these movements forward and backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops
All their rushing and galloping at one another did little harm
the harm of disablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that flew over the fields on which these men were floundering about
re-formed them and brought them under discipline and under the influence of that discipline led them back to the zone of fire
who were near that region of fire and sometimes even entered it—repeatedly led into it huge masses of well-ordered troops
But contrary to what had always happened in their former battles
instead of the news they expected of the enemy’s flight
The handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without removing his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were being slaughtered
Berthier’s eyes turned to look at a general with a suite
Having dismounted he went up to the Emperor with rapid strides and in a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending reinforcements
He swore on his honor that the Russians were lost if the Emperor would give another division
Napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down without replying
Though there was no advantage in sending Friant’s division instead of Claparède’s
Napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing the part of a doctor who hinders by his medicines—a role he so justly understood and condemned
Friant’s division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke of the battlefield
From all sides adjutants continued to arrive at a gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing
came up to the Emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to His Majesty
de Beausset’s face and he glided away to the other generals
Napoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an ever-lucky gambler who
after recklessly flinging money about and always winning
suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of the game
he himself was still the same: he knew that and knew that he was now even more experienced and skillful than before
Even the enemy was the same as at Austerlitz and Friedland—yet the terrible stroke of his arm had supernaturally become impotent
after he had given two or three orders and uttered a few phrases
and they all shunned one another’s eyes—only a de Beausset could fail to grasp the meaning of what was happening
He knew that it was a lost battle and that the least accident might now—with the fight balanced on such a strained center—destroy him and his army
when he looked at the concealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the Russians still holding their ground—a terrible feeling like a nightmare took possession of him
In former battles he had only considered the possibilities of success
it was like a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him
and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knows should annihilate him
but then feels that his arm drops powerless and limp like a rag
and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him in his helplessness
The Russians stood in serried ranks behind Semënovsk village and its knoll
and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent forth clouds of smoke
It was no longer a battle: it was a continuous slaughter which could be of no avail either to the French or the Russians
Napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie from which Berthier had aroused him
exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this general’s senseless offer
He listened to the reports that were brought him and gave directions when his subordinates demanded that of him; but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he were not interested in the import of the words spoken
that it is impossible for one man to direct hundreds of thousands of others struggling with death
but by that intangible force called the spirit of the army
and he watched this force and guided it in as far as that was in his power
Kutúzov’s general expression was one of concentrated quiet attention
and his face wore a strained look as if he found it difficult to master the fatigue of his old and feeble body
and then turned to the Duke of Württemberg who was standing behind him
Will Your Highness please take command of the first army
Soon after the duke’s departure—before he could possibly have reached Semënovsk—his adjutant came back from him and told Kutúzov that the duke asked for more troops
Kutúzov made a grimace and sent an order to Dokhtúrov to take over the command of the first army
and a request to the duke—whom he said he could not spare at such an important moment—to return to him
But he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army
The attack directed by Napoleon against our left flank had been several times repulsed
In the center the French had not got beyond Borodinó
and sent his favorite officer to the commander in chief with that news
and looking severely at the dishes in front of Kutúzov he began to report to  the old gentleman  the position of affairs on the left flank as Barclay had ordered him to and as he himself had seen and understood it
All the points of our position are in the enemy’s hands and we cannot dislodge them for lack of troops
who had spent the whole day at the most important part of the field of Borodinó
ride along the line and announce that tomorrow we attack
While Kutúzov was talking to Raévski and dictating the order of the day
immediately became known from one end of the army to the other
It was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the farthest links of that chain
The tales passing from mouth to mouth at different ends of the army did not even resemble what Kutúzov had said
but the sense of his words spread everywhere because what he said was not the outcome of cunning calculations
but of a feeling that lay in the commander in chief’s soul as in that of every Russian
And on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy
was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap between Semënovsk and the Knoll Battery
where thousands of men perished that day and on which an intense
concentrated fire from several hundred enemy guns was directed between one and two o’clock
and out of the mysterious domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front
a quarter of an hour passed during which the cannon balls and shells all flew overhead
but sometimes several men were torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually being dragged away and the wounded carried off
polished his bayonet; another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his bandolier
while another smoothed and refolded his leg bands and put his boots on again
A battery of artillery was passing in front of the regiment
calculating how often he must walk from one strip to another to walk a mile
He listened with weary ears to the ever-recurring sounds
distinguishing the whistle of flying projectiles from the booming of the reports
like a bird whirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground
The smoking shell spun like a top between him and the prostrate adjutant
At one and the same moment came the sound of an explosion
blood was welling out making a large stain on the grass
The militiamen with stretchers who were called up stood behind the officers
seizing by their shoulders and checking the peasants
who had run up and was looking down on the stretcher
Prince Andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from the stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyelids drooped
Around the wounded stood crowds of soldier stretcher-bearers with dismal and attentive faces
the soldiers stood leaning against their stretchers and gazing intently
as if trying to comprehend the difficult problem of what was taking place before them
or to point out those who were to be brought in next
a crowd of wounded and stretcher-bearers was gathered
There was something in this life I did not and do not understand
CHAPTER XXXVII  One of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron
Prince Andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only just been cleared and which a dresser was washing down
Prince Andrew could not make out distinctly what was in that tent
All he saw about him merged into a general impression of naked
and the shape of his head seemed strangely familiar to Prince Andrew
and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused Prince Andrew to lose consciousness
Prince Andrew enjoyed a blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time
felt happy in the mere consciousness of life—returned to his memory
not merely as something past but as something present
or because of those memories of a childhood that could not return
And suddenly a new unexpected memory from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to him
He remembered Natásha as he had seen her for the first time at the ball in 1810
and ecstatic pity and love for that man overflowed his happy heart
CHAPTER XXXVIII  The terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and wounded
together with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twenty generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded
and the consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm
This day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame that strength of mind which he thought constituted his merit and his greatness
With painful dejection he awaited the end of this action
human feeling for a brief moment got the better of the artificial phantasm of life he had served so long
He felt in his own person the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield
But when he had been on the Semënovsk heights the artillery commander had proposed to him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those heights to strengthen the fire on the Russian troops crowded in front of Knyazkóvo
Napoleon had assented and had given orders that news should be brought to him of the effect those batteries produced
Even before he gave that order the thing he did not desire
And he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary greatness
And not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience darkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening lay more than on all the others who took part in it
as he rode over the battlefield strewn with men killed and maimed (by his will as he believed)
find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that there were five Russians for every Frenchman
Helena in the peaceful solitude where he said he intended to devote his leisure to an account of the great deeds he had done
The European system was already founded; all that remained was to organize it
Satisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere
In that reunion of great sovereigns we should have discussed our interests like one family
and anyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself always in the common fatherland
predestined by Providence for the gloomy role of executioner of the peoples
and so on: it included scarcely a hundred and forty thousand who spoke French
The Russian expedition actually cost France less than fifty thousand men; the Russian army in its retreat from Vílna to Moscow lost in the various battles four times more men than the French army; the burning of Moscow cost the lives of a hundred thousand Russians who died of cold and want in the woods; finally
He imagined that the war with Russia came about by his will
and the horrors that occurred did not stagger his soul
He boldly took the whole responsibility for what happened
and his darkened mind found justification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who perished there were fewer Frenchmen than Hessians and Bavarians
and Semënovsk had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle
previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter of bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun
there now spread a mist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of saltpeter and blood
At any moment these men might have been seized with horror at what they were doing and might have thrown up everything and run away anywhere
and that terrible work which was not done by the will of a man but at the will of Him who governs men and worlds continued
it would disappear; and anyone looking at the rear of the French army would have said that the Russians need only make one more slight effort and the French would be destroyed
The Russians did not make that effort because they were not attacking the French
At the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the way to Moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the beginning
there was no part of the Russian army that had not suffered in the battle
The French who had attacked the Russian army in order to drive it from its position ought to have made that effort
for as long as the Russians continued to block the road to Moscow as before
and soldiers of the French army knew it could not be done
because the flagging spirit of the troops would not permit it
It was not Napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling of the mighty arm being stricken powerless
but all the generals and soldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not
stood as threateningly at the end as at the beginning of the battle
The moral force of the attacking French army was exhausted
and of the ground on which the troops had stood and were standing
bleeding from the mortal wound it had received at Borodinó
on which at Borodinó for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger spirit had been laid
BOOK ELEVEN: 1812      CHAPTER I  Absolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human mind
Laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only when he examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion; but at the same time
so-called sophism of the ancients consisting in this
that Achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following
in spite of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise
By the time Achilles has covered the distance that separated him from the tortoise
The absurd answer (that Achilles could never overtake the tortoise) resulted from this: that motion was arbitrarily divided into discontinuous elements
whereas the motion both of Achilles and of the tortoise was continuous
Only when we have admitted the conception of the infinitely small
and the resulting geometrical progression with a common ratio of one tenth
when dealing with problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely small
and so conforms to the chief condition of motion (absolute continuity) and thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannot avoid when it deals with separate elements of motion instead of examining continuous motion
man’s mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected units
The first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selected series of continuous events and examine it apart from others
though there is and can be no beginning to any event
for one event always flows uninterruptedly from another
The second method is to consider the actions of some one man—a king or a commander—as equivalent to the sum of many individual wills; whereas the sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of a single historic personage
It needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions drawn from history
It is merely necessary to select some larger or smaller unit as the subject of observation—as criticism has every right to do
seeing that whatever unit history observes must always be arbitrarily selected
the individual tendencies of men) and attaining to the art of integrating them (that is
finding the sum of these infinitesimals) can we hope to arrive at the laws of history
lay before us the sayings and doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of Paris
calling these sayings and doings  the Revolution ; then they give a detailed biography of Napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to him; tell of the influence some of these people had on others
and say: that is why this movement took place and those are its laws
But the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation
but plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious
because in it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger
The sum of human wills produced the Revolution and Napoleon
and only the sum of those wills first tolerated and then destroyed them
human reason replies: every time conquerors appear there have been wars
but this does not prove that the conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of a war in the personal activity of a single man
Whenever I look at my watch and its hands point to ten
I hear the bells of the neighboring church; but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock reach ten
I have no right to assume that the movement of the bells is caused by the position of the hands of the watch
Whenever I see the movement of a locomotive I hear the whistle and see the valves opening and wheels turning; but I have no right to conclude that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of the movement of the engine
The peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the oaks are budding
and really every spring cold winds do blow when the oak is budding
But though I do not know what causes the cold winds to blow when the oak buds unfold
I cannot agree with the peasants that the unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind
for the force of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds
I see only a coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of life
And attempts in this direction have already been made
infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are moved
No one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance in this way toward an understanding of the laws of history; but it is evident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering the laws of history lie
and ministers and propounding the historians’ own reflections concerning these actions
CHAPTER II  The forces of a dozen European nations burst into Russia
just as the velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches the earth
Behind it were seven hundred miles of hunger-stricken
hostile country; ahead were a few dozen miles separating it from its goal
Every soldier in Napoleon’s army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum
The more the Russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred of the enemy flared up
but the Russian army retreated immediately after the collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with another having a greater momentum
and with equal inevitability the ball of invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on for some distance
though the collision had deprived it of all its force
The Russians retreated eighty miles—to beyond Moscow—and the French reached Moscow and there came to a standstill
as everyone who had taken part in the battle knew it
the French army advanced of itself upon the Russians
For people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are made by generals—as anyone of us sitting over a map in his study may imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle—the questions present themselves: Why did Kutúzov during the retreat not do this or that
the inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any commander in chief
The activity of a commander in chief does not at all resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in our studies examining some campaign on the map
A commander in chief is never dealing with the beginning of any event—the position from which we always contemplate it
The commander in chief is always in the midst of a series of shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider the whole import of an event that is occurring
Learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that Kutúzov should have moved his army to the Kalúga road long before reaching Filí
on the twenty-eighth it is suggested to him to cross to the Kalúga road
And the order to retreat carries us past the turn to the Kalúga road
And after the adjutant comes the commissary general asking where the stores are to be taken
and the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go
the man who is undermining him (and there are always not merely one but several such)
presents a new project diametrically opposed to that of turning to the Kalúga road
and the commander in chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy and a respectable general who has been overlooked in the distribution of rewards comes to complain
and the inhabitants of the district pray to be defended
all describe the position of the enemy’s army differently
quite freely decide whether to abandon Moscow or defend it; whereas
At Drissa and at Smolénsk and most palpably of all on the twenty-fourth of August at Shevárdino and on the twenty-sixth at Borodinó
having been sent by Kutúzov to inspect the position
tried to keep near the commander in chief (whose bench formed the center of the gathering) and to speak so that he might overhear them
The commander in chief listened to what was being said and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks
but did not himself take part in the conversations or express any opinion
After hearing what was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turned away with an air of disappointment
criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental capacity of those who had chosen it
(This Frenchman and one of the German princes serving with the Russian army were discussing the siege of Saragossa and considering the possibility of defending Moscow in a similar manner
Count Rostopchín was telling a fourth group that he was prepared to die with the city train bands under the walls of the capital
but that he still could not help regretting having been left in ignorance of what was happening
displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptions
Kutúzov’s expression grew more and more preoccupied and gloomy
so utterly impossible that if any senseless commander were to give orders to fight
confusion would result but the battle would still not take place
It would not take place because the commanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible
but in their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its inevitable abandonment
How could the commanders lead their troops to a field of battle they considered impossible to hold
If Bennigsen insisted on the position being defended and others still discussed it
warmly displayed his Russian patriotism (Kutúzov could not listen to this without wincing) by insisting that Moscow must be defended
His aim was as clear as daylight to Kutúzov: if the defense failed
to throw the blame on Kutúzov who had brought the army as far as the Sparrow Hills without giving battle; if it succeeded
But this intrigue did not now occupy the old man’s mind
One terrible question absorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone
The army must retreat and the order to do so must be given
To give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to resigning the command of the army
but he was convinced that he was destined to save Russia and that that was why
He was convinced that he alone could maintain command of the army in these difficult circumstances
and that in all the world he alone could encounter the invincible Napoleon without fear
and he rode to Filí where his carriages were waiting
Andrew’s six-year-old granddaughter whom his Serene Highness had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugar while drinking his tea
remained on the top of the brick oven in the larger room
Those who entered went up one by one to the field marshal; he pressed the hands of some and nodded to others
His adjutant Kaysárov was about to draw back the curtain of the window facing Kutúzov
George’s Cross round his neck and looked pale and ill
twitching forward the black hair on his temples as was his habit
who on the pretext of inspecting the position was finishing his savory dinner
They waited for him from four till six o’clock and did not begin their deliberations all that time but talked in low tones of other matters
Only when Bennigsen had entered the hut did Kutúzov leave his corner and draw toward the table
but not near enough for the candles that had been placed there to light up his face
Admitting the view of Barclay and others that a defensive battle at Filí was impossible
but imbued with Russian patriotism and the love of Moscow
It seemed to her that it was only a personal struggle between  Granddad  and  Long-coat  as she termed Bennigsen
and then to her joys she saw that  Granddad  said something to  Long-coat  which settled him
Bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced angrily up and down the room
but pauses frequently occurred and they all felt that there was no more to be said
and slipping between the legs of the generals she darted out of the room
When he had dismissed the generals Kutúzov sat a long time with his elbows on the table
thinking always of the same terrible question:  When
who is usually represented as being the instigator of that event
acted in an altogether different manner from Kutúzov
not by reasoning but by the feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers
The same thing that took place in Moscow had happened in all the towns and villages on Russian soil beginning with Smolénsk
feeling within it the strength to find what it should do at that most difficult moment
And as soon as the enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their property
while the poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was left
taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half their belongings
and therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results
It is impossible to suppose that Rostopchín had scared them by his accounts of horrors Napoleon had committed in conquered countries
They went away even before the battle of Borodinó and still more rapidly after it
sorry as they were to abandon their property to destruction
They went away without thinking of the tremendous significance of that immense and wealthy city being given over to destruction
afraid of being stopped by Count Rostopchín’s orders
had already in June moved with her Negroes and her women jesters from Moscow to her Sarátov estate
who now taunted those who left Moscow and now had the government offices removed; now distributed quite useless weapons to the drunken rabble; now had processions displaying the icons
and now forbade Father Augustin to remove icons or the relics of saints; now seized all the private carts in Moscow and on one hundred and thirty-six of them removed the balloon that was being constructed by Leppich; now hinted that he would burn Moscow and related how he had set fire to his own house; now wrote a proclamation to the French solemnly upbraiding them for having destroyed his Orphanage; now claimed the glory of having hinted that he would burn Moscow and now repudiated the deed; now ordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him
and now reproached them for doing so; now expelled all the French residents from Moscow
and now allowed Madame Aubert-Chalmé (the center of the whole French colony in Moscow) to remain
handed over to them a man to be killed and himself drove away by a back gate; now declared that he would not survive the fall of Moscow
and now wrote French verses in albums concerning his share in the affair—this man did not understand the meaning of what was happening but merely wanted to do something himself that would astonish people
to perform some patriotically heroic feat; and like a child he made sport of the momentous
In Petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee who occupied one of the highest posts in the Empire
In Vílna she had formed an intimacy with a young foreign prince
Hélène was faced by a new problem—how to preserve her intimacy with both without offending either
What would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman did not cause the least embarrassment to Countess Bezúkhova
or tried to extricate herself from her awkward position by cunning
it may be that he has other sentiments for me than those of a father
said through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying
that there were precedents (there were up to that time very few
The prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred to him
put an end to her discourse with her future directeur de conscience
One day he took the countess to a Roman Catholic church
A few days later Hélène learned with pleasure that she had now been admitted to the true Catholic Church and that in a few days the Pope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain document
All that was done around her and to her at this time
and the state of dove-like purity she was now in (she wore only white dresses and white ribbons all that time) gave her pleasure
but her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim
And as it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets the better of cleverer ones
to obtain money from her for Jesuit institutions (as to which she received indications)—before parting with her money insisted that the various operations necessary to free her from her husband should be performed
with a subtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beauty
occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on the subject
The course of the Father Confessor’s arguments ran as follows:  Ignorant of the import of what you were undertaking
you made a vow of conjugal fidelity to a man who on his part
said with one of her bewitching smiles:  But I think that having espoused the true religion I cannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me
The director of her conscience was astounded at having the case presented to him thus with the simplicity of Columbus’ egg
He was delighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupil’s progress
and began refuting his spiritual daughter’s arguments
CHAPTER VII  Hélène understood that the question was very simple and easy from the ecclesiastical point of view
and that her directors were making difficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the matter would be regarded by the secular authorities
So she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society
She provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what she had told her other suitor; that is
she put the matter so that the only way for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her
but Hélène’s imperturbable conviction that it was as simple and natural as marrying a maiden had its effect on him too
not that Hélène wanted to be divorced from her husband (had such a report spread many would have opposed so illegal an intention) but simply that the unfortunate and interesting Hélène was in doubt which of the two men she should marry
The question was no longer whether this was possible
some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height of such a question
who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament of marriage
but there were not many such and they remained silent
while the majority were interested in Hélène’s good fortune and in the question which match would be the more advantageous
Whether it was right or wrong to remarry while one had a husband living they did not discuss
who had come to Petersburg that summer to see one of her sons
allowed herself plainly to express an opinion contrary to the general one
who of late very often forgot what he had said and repeated one and the same thing a hundred times
who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man
She was continually tormented by jealousy of her daughter
The young man who had entered took no notice of her
and asking him to carry out all the formalities necessary for a divorce
in His holy and powerful keeping—Your friend Hélène
This letter was brought to Pierre’s house when he was on the field of Borodinó
having run down from Raévski’s battery a second time
The one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away quickly from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and return to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his own bed
He felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he be able to understand himself and all he had seen and felt
But such ordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be found
Though shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along which he was going
and besides this there were the foul air and the dust
gazing at the shadows that moved past him in the darkness
got the fire to burn and placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some dried bread and put a little dripping
and handed Pierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean
helping himself to large spoonfuls and chewing one after another
In the total darkness the soldiers walked with Pierre to Mozháysk
had he not halfway up the hill stumbled upon his groom
who had been to look for him in the town and was returning to the inn
and a feeling of horror and dread of death seized him
Or I might have been sent to serve as a soldier after the duel with Dólokhov
And now a picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mind
Pierre did not understand what his benefactor was saying
and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak had in fact slipped
but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there
There were only thoughts clearly expressed in words
thoughts that someone was uttering or that he himself was formulating
been able to think and express his thoughts like that when awake
I want to understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream
On the way Pierre was told of the death of his brother-in-law Anatole and of that of Prince Andrew
CHAPTER X  On the thirtieth of August Pierre reached Moscow
Pierre took a cab and drove to see the Moscow commander in chief
Count Rostopchín had only that morning returned to town from his summer villa at Sokólniki
The anteroom and reception room of his house were full of officials who had been summoned or had come for orders
Vasílchikov and Plátov had already seen the count and explained to him that it was impossible to defend Moscow and that it would have to be surrendered
Though this news was being concealed from the inhabitants
and to escape personal responsibility they had all come to the governor to ask how they were to deal with their various departments
the courier made a despairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room
After greeting Pierre they continued their conversation
If they’re sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harm
His Serene Highness has passed through Mozháysk in order to join up with the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong position where the enemy will not soon attack him
Forty-eight guns with ammunition have been sent him from here
but a three-pronged fork will be best of all: a Frenchman is no heavier than a sheaf of rye
am well now: one of my eyes was sore but now I am on the lookout with both
indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant overcoat
The young man is in prison and I expect it will go hard with him
His father keeps a cookshop here by the Stone Bridge
and so have others who on the plea of building up the temple of Solomon have tried to destroy the temple of their fatherland
You can understand that there are reasons for this and that I could not have exiled the Postmaster had he not been a harmful person
It has now come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage for his removal from town
and that you have even accepted papers from him for safe custody
Vereshchágin is a renegade and a traitor who will be punished as he deserves
but to give you advice—or an order if you prefer it
I beg you to leave the town and break off all communication with such men as Klyucharëv
is it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy fathers of the Society of Jesus
They all had business with Pierre and wanted decisions from him
Pierre did not understand and was not interested in any of these questions and only answered them in order to get rid of these people
And going to his bed he threw himself on it without undressing and immediately fell asleep
had come from Count Rostopchín to know whether Count Bezúkhov had left or was leaving the town
that today or tomorrow either or both of them might be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances
struck her that summer for the first time with cruel clearness
She tried to get Nicholas back and wished to go herself to join Pétya
Pétya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless he was transferred to another regiment on active service
Nicholas was somewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letter
the count at last devised means to tranquillize her
this transfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one of her sons under her wing
and she hoped to arrange matters for her Pétya so as not to let him go again
but always get him appointed to places where he could not possibly take part in a battle
As long as Nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved her first-born more than all her other children and even reproached herself for it; but when her youngest: the scapegrace who had been bad at lessons
was always breaking things in the house and making himself a nuisance to everybody
At the end of August the Rostóvs received another letter from Nicholas
Knowing that one son was out of danger she became the more anxious about Pétya
Though by the twentieth of August nearly all the Rostóvs’ acquaintances had left Moscow
The passionate tenderness with which his mother received him did not please the sixteen-year-old officer
Owing to the count’s customary carelessness nothing was ready for their departure by the twenty-eighth of August and the carts that were to come from their Ryazán and Moscow estates to remove their household belongings did not arrive till the thirtieth
From the twenty-eighth till the thirty-first all Moscow was in a bustle and commotion
Every day thousands of men wounded at Borodinó were brought in by the Dorogomílov gate and taken to various parts of Moscow
the strangest and most contradictory rumors were current in the town
Some said that no one was to be allowed to leave the city
others on the contrary said that all the icons had been taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave
Some said there had been another battle after Borodinó at which the French had been routed
and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and save their belongings
It was felt that everything would suddenly break up and change
but up to the first of September nothing had done so
As a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must die immediately
though it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the conditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would be completely upset
was constantly in pursuit of Pétya who was always running away from her
and was jealous of Natásha with whom he spent all his time
Sónya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting things packed
But of late Sónya had been particularly sad and silent
who saw an intervention of Providence in this meeting of the princess and Nicholas
she took on herself all the difficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things and was busy for whole days
were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to everyone
They laughed and were gay not because there was any reason to laugh
but because gaiety and mirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and laughter to them
he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army
Sónya was in the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china
gazing fixedly at the floor and holding in her hands the old ball dress (already out of fashion) which she had worn at her first Petersburg ball
Natásha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy
and she could not and did not know how to do anything except with all her heart and all her might
For a while she had stood beside Sónya while the china was being packed and tried to help
but soon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things
At first she found it amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids
and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to what ought to have occupied her thoughts now
gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast mats
and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside
and he pointed to a stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts
though she was still holding the ends of her handkerchief
The cart in which the officer lay was turned into the Rostóvs’ yard
and dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the houses in Povarskáya Street
Natásha was evidently pleased to be dealing with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life
Natásha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the half-open door into the sitting room
And the count gave a similar order to the major-domo and the servants
At dinner Pétya having returned home told them the news he had heard
He said the people had been getting arms in the Krémlin
and that though Rostopchín’s broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three days in advance
said that she would die of fright if they did not leave that very night
increased the countess’ fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit dealer’s in Myasnítski Street
When returning by that street she had been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the shop
kept passing from the yard to the house and back again
with the ardor characteristic of all she did suddenly set to work too
At first her intervention in the business of packing was received skeptically
Everybody expected some prank from her and did not wish to obey her; but she resolutely and passionately demanded obedience
The count had valuable Gobelin tapestries and Persian carpets in the house
and still more was being brought in from the storeroom
She turned everything out and began quickly repacking
and it turned out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been rejected
the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases
She at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her completely
The count was not angry even when they told him that Natásha had countermanded an order of his
and the most valuable packed as compactly as possible
Sónya and Natásha slept in the sitting room without undressing
Mávra Kuzmínichna concluded that he was a very important man
On the box beside the driver sat a venerable old attendant
Having waited there for Rostopchín who did not turn up
they became convinced that Moscow would be surrendered
but the value of paper money and city articles kept falling
and receiving in payment a half of what they carted
In the Rostóvs’ staid old-fashioned house the dissolution of former conditions of life was but little noticeable
As to the serfs the only indication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared during the night
but nothing was stolen; and as to the value of their possessions
the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their estates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and they were offered enormous sums of money for them
Not only were huge sums offered for the horses and carts
but on the previous evening and early in the morning of the first of September
orderlies and servants sent by wounded officers came to the Rostóvs’ and wounded men dragged themselves there from the Rostóvs’ and from neighboring houses where they were accommodated
entreating the servants to try to get them a lift out of Moscow
On waking up that morning Count Ilyá Rostóv left his bedroom softly
so as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning
The major-domo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to a pale young officer with a bandaged arm
wounded officers and their orderlies were to be seen
who had been her lady’s maid before her marriage and now performed a sort of chief gendarme’s duty for her
the countess learned that Madame Schoss was offended because her trunk had been taken down from its cart
The countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of something detrimental to the children’s interests
such as the building of a new gallery or conservatory
the inauguration of a private theater or an orchestra
She was accustomed always to oppose anything announced in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do so
you have managed matters so that we are getting nothing for the house
and now you wish to throw away all our—all the children’s property
was already a colonel wearing the orders of Vladímir and Anna
and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the first division of the Second Army
but he had noticed that everyone in the army was asking for leave to visit Moscow and had something to do there
So he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and domestic reasons
He looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it
Is the army retreating or will there be another battle
Papa  (he smote himself on the breast as a general he had heard speaking had done
And Berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had heard those days
Natásha watched him with an intent gaze that confused him
as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some question
and there is a small chiffonier and a dressing table
You know how dear Véra wanted a chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it
The count stood by the window and listened without turning round
at the rapid pace at which she used to run when playing at tag
confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the trunks to the storerooms
When they understood that order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal
It no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could be done
set eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts
The wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but happy faces round the carts
The news that carts were to be had spread to the neighboring houses
from which wounded men began to come into the Rostóvs’ yard
and mirrors that had been so carefully packed the night before now lay about the yard
but the aim of her efforts was quite different from Natásha’s
She was putting away the things that had to be left behind and making a list of them as the countess wished
and she tried to get as much taken away with them as possible
One by one the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard
The calèche in which Prince Andrew was being taken attracted Sónya’s attention as it passed the front porch
and while they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words
In the porch and in the yard the men whom Pétya had armed with swords and daggers
and for a long time two menservants stood one on each side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help the countess in
who was the only one the countess trusted to drive her
sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as glance round at what was going on behind him
would be given him: and he knew that even when it was said he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back to fetch something that had been forgotten
and even after that he would again be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg him for the love of heaven to drive carefully down the hill
and the countess leaned out and said what she had to say
Then Efím deliberately doffed his hat and began crossing himself
The footman sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out of the yard onto the uneven roadway; the other vehicles jolted in their turn
all crossed themselves as they passed the church opposite the house
Those who were to remain in Moscow walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off
Rarely had Natásha experienced so joyful a feeling as now
Occasionally she leaned out of the carriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train of wounded in front of them
and Podnovínsk Streets came several other trains of vehicles similar to the Rostóvs’
and as they passed along the Sadóvaya Street the carriages and carts formed two rows abreast
As they were going round the Súkharev water tower Natásha
who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently a gentleman in disguise
for from the Meshchánski Street came more carts and carriages
the Rostóvs all saw Pierre—or someone extraordinarily like him—in a coachman’s coat
That old man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them
and following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach
and dropping behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement
When he woke up on the morning after his return to Moscow and his interview with Count Rostopchín
he could not for some time make out where he was and what was expected of him
His major-domo came in a second time to say that the Frenchman who had brought the letter from the countess was very anxious to see him if only for a minute
and as soon as Pierre stepped out of the gate the coachmen and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to him
When he felt he was being looked at he behaved like an ostrich which hides its head in a bush in order not to be seen: he hung his head and quickening his pace went down the street
Of all the affairs awaiting Pierre that day the sorting of Joseph Bazdéev’s books and papers appeared to him the most necessary
Continually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that were making their way from all sides out of Moscow
The man told him that arms were being distributed today at the Krémlin and that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the Three Hills gates and a great battle would be fought there
On seeing Pierre he muttered something angrily and went away along the passage
but Sophia Danílovna gave orders that if anyone should come from you they were to have the books
dusty and untouched since the death of Joseph Bazdéev was now even gloomier
approached the cupboard in which the manuscripts were kept
and resting his head on his hand sank into meditation
Gerásim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw Pierre always sitting in the same attitude
All the rest of that day Pierre spent alone in his benefactor’s study
and Gerásim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to another and talking to himself
being a servant who in his time had seen many strange things
Makár Alexéevich came twice that evening shuffling along in his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at Pierre
But as soon as Pierre turned toward him he wrapped his dressing gown around him with a shamefaced and angry look and hurried away
It was when Pierre (wearing the coachman’s coat which Gerásim had procured for him and had disinfected by steam) was on his way with the old man to buy the pistol at the Súkharev market that he met the Rostóvs
those nearing the town at the Dorogomílov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers crowding and hurrying across the bridge
ascending on the opposite side and blocking the streets and alleys
Kutúzov himself had driven round by side streets to the other side of Moscow
By ten o’clock in the morning of the second of September
Napoleon was standing among his troops on the Poklónny Hill looking at the panorama spread out before him
From the twenty-sixth of August to the second of September
there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that always comes as a surprise
when the sun hangs low and gives more heat than in spring
when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear atmosphere that the eyes smart
golden stars startle and delight us continually by falling from the sky
filled Napoleon with the rather envious and uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has no knowledge of them
Every Russian looking at Moscow feels her to be a mother; every foreigner who sees her
yes—I will give them just laws; I will teach them the meaning of true civilization
that I have waged war only against the false policy of their court; that I love and respect Alexander and that in Moscow I will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people
Napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the same place on the Poklónny Hill awaiting the deputation
His speech to the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination
That speech was full of dignity and greatness as Napoleon understood it
He was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to adopt toward Moscow
Meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite
The faces of those who were not conferring together were pale and perturbed
They were not alarmed by the fact that Moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants (grave as that fact seemed)
but by the question how to tell the Emperor—without putting him in the terrible position of appearing ridiculous—that he had been awaiting the boyars so long in vain: that there were drunken mobs left in Moscow but no one else
Some said that a deputation of some sort must be scraped together
was pacing patiently up and down before the outspread map
vanishing amid the clouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar of mingling shouts
It was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty
In a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it seems as much alive as other hives
the smell and the sound that meet the beekeeper are not the same
To the beekeeper’s tap on the wall of the sick hive
instead of the former instant unanimous humming of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly compressed
and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an aerial living sound
comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling with the smell of honey
clinging to one another’s legs and drawing out the wax
with a ceaseless hum of labor—that used to hang in long clusters down to the floor of the hive
The beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super
Instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and keeping the brood warm
and butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their flight
by force of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells
with efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or bumblebee without knowing why they do it
The keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the brood cells
In various corners of Moscow there still remained a few people aimlessly moving about
following their old habits and hardly aware of what they were doing
CHAPTER XXI  The Russian troops were passing through Moscow from two o’clock at night till two in the afternoon and bore away with them the wounded and the last of the inhabitants who were leaving
turned back from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of Vasíli the Beatified and under the Borovítski gate
back up the hill to the Red Square where some instinct told them they could easily take things not belonging to them
Crowds of the kind seen at cheap sales filled all the passages and alleys of the Bazaar
But there were no dealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers to enter; there were no hawkers
entering the Bazaar empty-handed and silently making their way out through its passages with bundles
and themselves carried goods away with the help of their assistants
On the square in front of the Bazaar were drummers beating the muster call
From one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation
The officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops
Beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were harnessed
sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and desperate shrieks
He was told by his fellow officers that the screams of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that General Ermólov
coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were dispersing among the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the bridge
only here and there round the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be heard
Vasílich’s grandson who had stayed in Moscow with his grandfather
Go and get the samovar to boil for your grandfather
Mávra Kuzmínichna flicked the dust off the clavichord and closed it
and with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door
Going out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go next—to drink tea in the servants’ wing with Vasílich
or into the storeroom to put away what still lay about
I am a kinsman of the count’s and he has been very kind to me
went through the back yard to the servants’ quarters
And how am I to find the nearest way to overtake my regiment
Swaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself
the officer ran almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the Yaúza bridge to overtake his regiment
But Mávra Kuzmínichna stood at the closed gate for some time with moist eyes
pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected flow of motherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officer
The sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he always carefully rolled it up again with his left hand
who under the leadership of the tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning
hearing the sounds of revelry in the tavern and supposing it to have been broken into
wished to force their way in too and a fight in the porch had resulted
and snatching his cap from his head he flung it on the ground
As if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance
But he’s sucked our blood and now he thinks he’s quit of us
He’s been misleading us all the week and now that he’s brought us to this pass he’s made off
On seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased speaking
The man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of August 31
When the crowd collected round him he seemed confused
but at the demand of the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him
voices in the rear of the crowd were suddenly heard saying
who had gone that morning by Count Rostopchín’s orders to burn the barges and had in connection with that matter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his pocket
shouted different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap
voices in the crowd were heard saying more and more frequently
Count Rostopchín had returned to Moscow mortified and offended because he had not been invited to attend the council of war
and because Kutúzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in the defense of the city; amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him at the camp
After supper he lay down on a sofa without undressing
and was awakened soon after midnight by a courier bringing him a letter from Kutúzov
This letter requested the count to send police officers to guide the troops through the town
He had known that Moscow would be abandoned not merely since his interview the previous day with Kutúzov on the Poklónny Hill but ever since the battle of Borodinó
for all the generals who came to Moscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible to fight another battle
and since then the government property had been removed every night
and half the inhabitants had left the city with Rostopchín’s own permission
Yet all the same this information astonished and irritated the count
When later on in his memoirs Count Rostopchín explained his actions at this time
he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two important considerations: to maintain tranquillity in Moscow and expedite the departure of the inhabitants
One need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action finds a justification
was Count Rostopchín’s fear for the tranquillity of Moscow based in 1812
What reason was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city
Neither in Moscow nor anywhere in Russia did anything resembling an insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town
It is obvious that there would have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people if after the battle of Borodinó
when the surrender of Moscow became certain or at least probable
was a sanguine and impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to be guiding
Ever since the enemy’s entry into Smolénsk he had in imagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling of  the heart of Russia
Not only did it seem to him (as to all administrators) that he controlled the external actions of Moscow’s inhabitants
but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude by means of his broadsheets and posters
written in a coarse tone which the people despise in their own class and do not understand from those in authority
this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the count yielded reluctantly
He was absorbed in the role he had created for himself
As is often the case with those gifted with an ardent imagination
though he had long known that Moscow would be abandoned he knew it only with his intellect
he did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs
All his painstaking and energetic activity (in how far it was useful and had any effect on the people is another question) had been simply directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic hatred of the French
But when events assumed their true historical character
when expressing hatred for the French in words proved insufficient
when it was not even possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle
when self-confidence was of no avail in relation to the one question before Moscow
when the whole population streamed out of Moscow as one man
abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all the depth of their national feeling
without clearly defining who the villains and traitors were
for which people came to him from all parts of Moscow
All night long such announcements were continually being received by the count
When lunatics command our armies God evidently means these other madmen to be free
In reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison
Those who were able to get away were going of their own accord
those who remained behind decided for themselves what they must do
In quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is kept going
and in this consciousness of being indispensable every administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts
While the sea of history remains calm the ruler-administrator in his frail bark
holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people and himself moving
naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding on to
after reporting that he had executed the instructions he had received
informed the count that an immense crowd had collected in the courtyard and wished to see him
flourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look
The blood-stained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face
he thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his arm
And the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed the door behind him
the mob were saying as if reproving one another for their lack of confidence
The young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the spot indicated
looking round with a frightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him
The plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roar of the crowd
Like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship
that last irresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks
And the screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried to rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd
Only when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a long-drawn
along the passage leading to the rooms on the ground floor
The distant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there
He hastily took his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his country house in Sokólniki
Many other victims have perished and are perishing for the public good —and he began thinking of his social duties to his family and to the city entrusted to him
Had I been simply Theodore Vasílyevich my course of action would have been quite different
but it was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as commander in chief
as soon as he became physically tranquil his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too
The thought which tranquillized Rostopchín was not a new one
To a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain
Not only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done
I could not let him go unpunished and so I have killed two birds with one stone: to appease the mob I gave them a victim and at the same time punished a miscreant
Half an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the Sokólniki field
no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering what was to come
He was driving to the Yaúza bridge where he had heard that Kutúzov was
Count Rostopchín was mentally preparing the angry and stinging reproaches he meant to address to Kutúzov for his deception
could be seen some people in white and others like them walking singly across the field shouting and gesticulating
The calèche flew over the ground as fast as the horses could draw it
Rostopchín already felt that it had cut deep into his heart and drawn blood
dwell in his heart ever more cruelly and painfully to the end of his life
sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his whip in the sand when a calèche dashed up noisily
took up a Cossack whip and went to the bridge where he began with shouts to drive on the carts that blocked the way
CHAPTER XXVI  Toward four o’clock in the afternoon Murat’s troops were entering Moscow
Around Murat gathered a group of those who had remained in Moscow
They all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange
listening in perplexity to the unfamiliar Polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter was speaking Russian
did not understand what was being said to him and slipped behind the others
Murat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the Russian army was
ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates
The guns emerged at a trot from the column following Murat and advanced up the Arbát
When they reached the end of the Vozdvízhenka Street they halted and drew in the Square
and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as soon as an officer and men began to run toward it
and from behind the screens came the strange sound of a few voices shouting
and men changed to one of determined concentrated readiness for strife and suffering
The shot rattled against the stone of the gate and upon the wooden beams and screens
and two wavering clouds of smoke rose over the Square
A few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the stone-built Krémlin had died away the French heard a strange sound above their head
and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on that they might not stink
Thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to their memory:  These wretches had occupied the sacred citadel
The French entered the gates and began pitching their camp in the Senate Square
Out of the windows of the Senate House the soldiers threw chairs into the Square for fuel and kindled fires there
But it remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into their different lodgings
As soon as the men of the various regiments began to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses
the army was lost forever and there came into being something nondescript
each carrying a quantity of articles which seemed to him valuable or useful
Like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow neck of a jug
the French when they left Moscow had inevitably to perish because they carried their loot with them
yet to abandon what they had stolen was as impossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let go of its nuts
In cellars and storerooms similar men were busy among the provisions
and in the yards unlocking or breaking open coach house and stable doors
There were many such men both in the shops and houses—but there was no army
Order after order was issued by the French commanders that day forbidding the men to disperse about the town
deserted city with its comforts and plentiful supplies
As a hungry herd of cattle keeps well together when crossing a barren field
and quarreled and even fought with other companies for them
rushed to places where valuables were to be had for the taking
The officers followed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing the same
In Carriage Row carriages had been left in the shops
and generals flocked there to select calèches and coaches for themselves
The few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to their houses
hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered
There were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it
And Moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper
When water is spilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and mud results; and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the rich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction of both the army and the wealthy city
where scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house owners are in residence and a police force is present
cannot help burning when its inhabitants have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke pipes
In peacetime it is only necessary to billet troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires in that district immediately increases
and by the carelessness of enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own
Even if there was any arson (which is very doubtful
However tempting it might be for the French to blame Rostopchín’s ferocity and for Russians to blame the scoundrel Bonaparte
or later on to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people
but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remained in it
only reached the quarter where Pierre was staying by the evening of the second of September
He was completely obsessed by one persistent thought
and all he saw and heard appeared to him like a dream
He had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of life’s demands that enmeshed him
and in Joseph Alexéevich’s study he really found it
When he sat with his elbows on the dusty writing table in the deathlike stillness of the study
calm and significant memories of the last few days rose one after another in his imagination
and strength of the class of men he mentally classed as they
When Gerásim roused him from his reverie the idea occurred to him of taking part in the popular defense of Moscow which he knew was projected
And with that object he had asked Gerásim to get him a peasant’s coat and a pistol
confiding to him his intentions of remaining in Joseph Alexéevich’s house and keeping his name secret
Then during the first day spent in inaction and solitude (he tried several times to fix his attention on the Masonic manuscripts
having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part among the people in the defense of Moscow
But when he returned to the house convinced that Moscow would not be defended
and either perish or put an end to the misery of all Europe—which it seemed to him was solely due to Napoleon
And the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out his design excited him still more
Two equally strong feelings drew Pierre irresistibly to this purpose
The first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in view of the common calamity
the same feeling that had caused him to go to Mozháysk on the twenty-fifth and to make his way to the very thick of the battle and had now caused him to run away from his home and
in place of the luxury and comfort to which he was accustomed
to sleep on a hard sofa without undressing and eat the same food as Gerásim
and human—for everything the majority of men regard as the greatest good in the world
and life—all that men so painstakingly acquire and guard—if it has any worth has so only by reason of the joy with which it can all be renounced
It was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his last penny on drink
In his fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the blow or the death of Napoleon
They seized Makár Alexéevich by the arms and dragged him to the door
intending to conceal himself as soon as the French entered
having apparently decided that these were good quarters
turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance
and at the same moment Pierre threw himself on the drunkard
He is an unfortunate madman who did not know what he was doing
to persuade the officer not to hold that drunken imbecile to account
captain of the 13th Light Regiment—was undoubtedly a very great deed
In reply to his last question Pierre again explained who Makár Alexéevich was and how just before their arrival that drunken imbecile had seized the loaded pistol which they had not had time to recover from him
and begged the officer to let the deed go unpunished
and genuinely grateful to Pierre for saving his life that Pierre had not the heart to refuse
evidently not understanding how anyone could decline so flattering an appellation
shrugged his shoulders and said that if Pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a Russian let it be so
but for all that he would be forever bound to Pierre by gratitude for saving his life
Had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the feelings of others
a self-satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his lips under his mustache
Will you now be so good as to tell me with whom I have the honor of conversing so pleasantly
instead of being in the ambulance with that maniac’s bullet in my body
When the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and vodka brought
His face grew red and was covered with perspiration
and Morel spoke well of the limonade de cochon he had found in the kitchen
But as the captain had the wine they had taken while passing through Moscow
he left the kvass to Morel and applied himself to the bottle of Bordeaux
He wrapped the bottle up to its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for Pierre
Here is one I got at Wagram  (he touched his side)  and a second at Smolénsk —he showed a scar on his cheek— and this leg which as you see does not want to march
and so pleased with himself that Pierre almost winked back as he looked merrily at him
and noticing that his conclusion was weaker than what had gone before
and after the days he had spent alone with his depressing thoughts
I could not resist the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered France
Their conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at the gate and by Morel
who came to say that some Württemberg hussars had come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the captain’s horses were
answered the two first questions by giving the names of his regiment and of his commanding officer
The captain went out into the porch and gave some orders in a loud voice
suddenly he came to himself and realized the position he was in
It was not that Moscow had been taken or that the happy conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him
Painful as that was it was not that which tormented Pierre at the moment
He was tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness
but he felt a foreboding that he would not carry out his intention
and all about his relations and his financial and family affairs
and noting the eager enthusiasm with which he spoke of women
Though all Ramballe’s love stories had the sensual character which Frenchmen regard as the special charm and poetry of love
yet he told his story with such sincere conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of love and he described women so alluringly that Pierre listened to him with curiosity
It was plain that l’amour which the Frenchman was so fond of was not that low and simple kind that Pierre had once felt for his wife
nor was it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for Natásha
(Ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally: the one he considered the  love of clodhoppers  and the other the  love of simpletons
) L’amour which the Frenchman worshiped consisted principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling
The conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter
as well as several droll incidents from his recollections of Germany
the latest episode in Poland still fresh in the captain’s memory
and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face
was of how he had saved the life of a Pole (in general
Having repeated these words the captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake
While listening to these love stories his own love for Natásha unexpectedly rose to his mind
and going over the pictures of that love in his imagination he mentally compared them with Ramballe’s tales
Listening to the story of the struggle between love and duty
Pierre saw before his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object of his love at the Súkharev water tower
At the time of that meeting it had not produced an effect upon him—he had not even once recalled it
and there seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this
Having finished his tale about the enchanting Polish lady
the captain asked Pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband
Challenged by this question Pierre raised his head and felt a need to express the thoughts that filled his mind
He began to explain that he understood love for a woman somewhat differently
Pierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest years
but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too young
and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name
Pierre asked the captain whether he understood that
Urged on by Ramballe’s questions he also told what he had at first concealed—his own position and even his name
To the left of the house on the Pokróvka a fire glowed—the first of those that were beginning in Moscow
Pierre left the gate with unsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and immediately fell asleep
the road had been so blocked by vehicles and troops
so many things had been forgotten for which servants were sent back
that they had decided to spend that night at a place three miles out of Moscow
The next morning they woke late and were again delayed so often that they only got as far as Great Mytíshchi
At ten o’clock that evening the Rostóv family and the wounded traveling with them were all distributed in the yards and huts of that large village
In a neighboring hut lay Raévski’s adjutant with a fractured wrist
The awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously
and his moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night
He had spent the first night in the same yard as the Rostóvs
The countess said she had been unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning
and at Mytíshchi she moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from the wounded man
In the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed
That’s a fire in Moscow: either in the Sushchévski or the Rogózhski quarter
was sitting on the bench under the icons just where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to her father’s words
But Natásha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove
had for some unaccountable reason found it necessary to tell Natásha of Prince Andrew’s wound and of his being with their party
neither Moscow nor the burning of Moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to Natásha
The count returned and lay down behind the partition
The countess went up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she was wont to do when Natásha was ill
When Natásha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was seriously wounded and was traveling with their party
But after she had been told that she could not see him
and convinced that say what she might she would still be told the same
All the way she had sat motionless in a corner of the coach with wide open eyes
and the expression in them which the countess knew so well and feared so much
and now she sat in the same way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving
A bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only
Natásha replied irritably and she went to the window and opened it
and the countess saw her slim neck shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame
Natásha knew it was not Prince Andrew who was moaning
When she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket
she sat down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the floor
The small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in the room
But in the yard there was a light from the fire at Little Mytíshchi a mile and a half away
and through the night came the noise of people shouting at a tavern Mamónov’s Cossacks had set up across the street
and the adjutant’s unceasing moans could still be heard
For a long time Natásha listened attentively to the sounds that reached her from inside and outside the room and did not move
First she heard her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under her
After a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one replied
Stepping cautiously from one foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and grasped the cold door handle
It seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against all the walls of the room: it was her own heart
sinking with alarm and terror and overflowing with love
All day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night
and found herself in the middle of a small room containing baggage
Another man—Timókhin—was lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons
CHAPTER XXXII  Seven days had passed since Prince Andrew found himself in the ambulance station on the field of Borodinó
But on the seventh day he ate with pleasure a piece of bread with some tea
The first night after they left Moscow had been fairly warm and he had remained in the calèche
but at Mytíshchi the wounded man himself asked to be taken out and given some tea
The pain caused by his removal into the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness
When he had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with closed eyes
Then he opened them and whispered softly:  And the tea
and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved
He was dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did not die now
had joined him in Moscow and was being taken along with him
The doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he was feeling
Prince Andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but reasonably
and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was uncomfortable and in great pain
The doctor and valet lifted the cloak with which he was covered and
The doctor was very much displeased about something and made a change in the dressings
turning the wounded man over so that he groaned again and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony
The first time Prince Andrew understood where he was and what was the matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he asked to be carried into the hut after his calèche had stopped at Mytíshchi
After growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut he again regained consciousness
and while drinking tea once more recalled all that had happened to him
and above all vividly remembered the moment at the ambulance station when
at the sight of the sufferings of a man he disliked
The uncomfortable position in which they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts
and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around the candle beside him
but has the power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to fix his whole attention
A healthy man can tear himself away from the deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can then return again to his own thoughts
But Prince Andrew’s mind was not in a normal state in that respect
Most diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously
and depth it had never reached when he was in health
a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be deprived
he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut
And suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off
While listening to this whispering and feeling the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice of needles
he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle
and heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that flopped against his pillow and his face
Each time the fly touched his face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not destroy the structure
though it knocked against the very region of his face where it was rising
But besides this there was something else of importance
but why is it always stretching and drawing itself out
but the love which I—while dying—first experienced when I saw my enemy and yet loved him
not as he had done in the past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight
And his attention was suddenly carried into another world
a world of reality and delirium in which something particular was happening
But the face remained before him with the force of reality and drew nearer
and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a wounded man
it seemed might easily happen—she could not oppose Natásha
Though with the intimacy now established between the wounded man and Natásha the thought occurred that should he recover their former engagement would be renewed
no one—least of all Natásha and Prince Andrew—spoke of this: the unsettled question of life and death
the clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on his body
and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful he had done the day before
and seeing the pistol with an engraved stock which Gerásim had replaced on the writing table
probably he won’t make his entry into Moscow before noon
But it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could not carry the weapon in his hand through the streets
It was difficult to hide such a big pistol even under his wide coat
though when planning his design he had more than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by the student in 1809 had been to try to kill Napoleon with a dagger
But as his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design
but in proving to himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he could to achieve it
where he had long before decided that the deed should be done
Now and then he met Russians with anxious and timid faces
and the strange morose look of suffering in his face and whole figure
the Russians stared at Pierre because they could not make out to what class he could belong
The French followed him with astonishment in their eyes chiefly because Pierre
In another side street a sentinel standing beside a green caisson shouted at him
but only when the shout was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the man’s musket as he raised it did Pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side of the street
He heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around him
But he was not destined to bring his mood safely to his destination
for Napoleon had passed the Arbát more than four hours previously on his way from the Dorogomílov suburb to the Krémlin
and was now sitting in a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the Krémlin
But Pierre did not know this; he was entirely absorbed in what lay before him
and was tortured—as those are who obstinately undertake a task that is impossible for them not because of its difficulty but because of its incompatibility with their natures—by the fear of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his self-esteem
Though he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by instinct and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the Povarskóy
As Pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denser—he even felt the heat of the fire
Occasionally curly tongues of flame rose from under the roofs of the houses
As he was going along a footpath across a wide-open space adjoining the Povarskóy on one side and the gardens of Prince Gruzínski’s house on the other
Pierre suddenly heard the desperate weeping of a woman close to him
round-shouldered man in the undress uniform of a civilian official
Tongues of flame here and there broke through that cloud
A great number of people crowded in front of the conflagration
were about; but seeing before him a Frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying to take from him a fox-fur coat
now gathering into thick black clouds and now soaring up with glittering sparks
produced on Pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration
He ran round to the other side of the lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was still standing
when just above his head he heard several voices shouting and then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling close beside him
really did jump out of a window on the ground floor
When they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman pulled Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round
She screamed desperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull Pierre’s hands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth
Pierre was seized by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when touching some nasty little animal
and Pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the wet
painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ran with her through the garden seeking another way out
CHAPTER XXXIV  Having run through different yards and side streets
Pierre got back with his little burden to the Gruzínski garden at the corner of the Povarskóy
He did not at first recognize the place from which he had set out to look for the child
so crowded was it now with people and goods that had been dragged out of the houses
Besides Russian families who had taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings
He hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else
in her rich satin cloak with a bright lilac shawl on her head
suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out onto the snow
She was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old woman
Pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who had been sitting there with her other children
He had for some seconds been intently watching what was going on a few steps away
was wearing a blue coat tied round the waist with a rope
immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old man at once began pulling off his boots
The little Frenchman had secured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other
had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from his pockets had seized her by the neck
The beautiful Armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitude
with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what the soldier was doing to her
While Pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the Frenchman
knocked him off his feet and hammered him with his fists
Shouts of approval were heard from the crowd around
and at the same moment a mounted patrol of French Uhlans appeared from round the corner
The Uhlans came up at a trot to Pierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them
Pierre remembered nothing of what happened after that
A little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks
And without knowing how this aimless lie had escaped him
he went along with resolute and triumphant steps between the French soldiers
Pierre was considered to be the most suspicious of all
the same court interests and service interests and intrigues as usual
Only in the very highest circles were attempts made to keep in mind the difficulties of the actual position
concerned for the welfare of the charitable and educational institutions under her patronage
had given directions that they should all be removed to Kazán
when asked what instructions she would be pleased to give—with her characteristic Russian patriotism had replied that she could give no directions about state institutions for that was the affair of the sovereign
in a loud and singsong voice alternating between a despairing wail and a tender murmur
not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room
did not let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general conversation
The news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess Bezúkhova
She had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously
and instead of the celebrated Petersburg doctors who usually attended her had entrusted herself to some Italian doctor who was treating her in some new and unusual way
They all knew very well that the enchanting countess’ illness arose from an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time
Supposing that by these words Anna Pávlovna was somewhat lifting the veil from the secret of the countess’ malady
Anna Pávlovna suddenly and venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man
referring to a diplomatic note that had been sent to Vienna with some Austrian banners captured from the French by Wittgenstein
Prince Hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise
He knew no more than the others what his words meant
During his diplomatic career he had more than once noticed that such utterances were received as very witty
I grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing in the sight of your most gracious presence
was uttered in approval both of reader and of author
CHAPTER II  Anna Pávlovna’s presentiment was in fact fulfilled
Next day during the service at the palace church in honor of the Emperor’s birthday
and all that morning a joyously festive mood reigned in the city
Everyone believed the victory to have been complete
It is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from the scene of action
General events involuntarily group themselves around some particular incident
I always said he was the only man capable of defeating Napoleon
But next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew anxious
and instead of extolling Kutúzov as they had done the day before
they condemned him as the cause of the Emperor’s anxiety
That day Prince Vasíli no longer boasted of his protégé Kutúzov
everyone said that Countess Bezúkhova had died of a terrible attack of angina pectoris
but in intimate circles details were mentioned of how the private physician of the Queen of Spain had prescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect; but Hélène
and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her
It was said that Prince Vasíli and the old count had turned upon the Italian
but the latter had produced such letters from the unfortunate deceased that they had immediately let the matter drop
On the third day after Kutúzov’s report a country gentleman arrived from Moscow
and Prince Vasíli during the visits of condolence paid to him on the occasion of his daughter’s death said of Kutúzov
whom he had formerly praised (it was excusable for him in his grief to forget what he had said)
that it was impossible to expect anything else from a blind and depraved old man
I only wonder that the fate of Russia could have been entrusted to such a man
As long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it
Kutúzov’s action decides the fate of the capital and of your empire
and it only remains for me to weep over the fate of my fatherland
On receiving this dispatch the Emperor sent Prince Volkónski to Kutúzov with the following rescript:  Prince Michael Ilariónovich
Since the twenty-ninth of August I have received no communication from you
I am sending this by Adjutant-General Prince Volkónski
to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasons that have induced you to take this melancholy decision
CHAPTER III  Nine days after the abandonment of Moscow
who had never seen Moscow before the campaign and who did not know Russian
Michaud’s chagrin must have been different from that which caused Russians to grieve
Michaud respectfully delivered the message Kutúzov had entrusted to him
which was that it had been impossible to fight before Moscow
drawing himself up to his full height and addressing Michaud with a gracious and majestic gesture
raising to heaven his fine eyes shining with emotion
I shall let my beard grow to here  (he pointed halfway down his chest)  and go and eat potatoes with the meanest of my peasants
rather than sign the disgrace of my country and of my beloved people whose sacrifices I know how to appreciate
he strode back to Michaud and pressed his arm below the elbow with a vigorous movement
—at that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that he had heard (as he used afterwards to say)
Your Majesty is at this moment signing the glory of the nation and the salvation of Europe
With an inclination of the head the Emperor dismissed him
CHAPTER IV  It is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine that when half Russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were fleeing to distant provinces
and one levy after another was being raised for the defense of the fatherland
It appears so to us because we see only the general historic interest of that time and do not see all the personal human interests that people had
Yet in reality those personal interests of the moment so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the public interest from being felt or even noticed
Most of the people at that time paid no attention to the general progress of events but were guided only by their private interests
and they were the very people whose activities at that period were most useful
and all they did for the common good turned out to be useless and foolish—like Pierre’s and Mamónov’s regiments which looted Russian villages
fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelings
who discussed Russia’s position at the time involuntarily introduced into their conversation either a shade of pretense and falsehood or useless condemnation and anger directed against people accused of actions no one could possibly be guilty of
and he who plays a part in an historic event never understands its significance
If he tries to realize it his efforts are fruitless
The more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in Russia the less did he realize their significance
wept for Russia and its ancient capital and talked of self-sacrifice and so on; but in the army which retired beyond Moscow there was little talk or thought of Moscow
and he therefore looked at what was going on in Russia without despair and without dismally racking his brains over it
Had he been asked what he thought of the state of Russia
he would have said that it was not his business to think about it
that Kutúzov and others were there for that purpose
but that he had heard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength
that fighting would probably go on for a long time yet
he learned that he was being sent to Vorónezh to buy remounts for his division
not only without regret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle
he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time
who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should joke with them
In the highest spirits Nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in Vorónezh
The commander of the militia was a civilian general
an old man who was evidently pleased with his military designation and rank
He received Nicholas brusquely (imagining this to be characteristically military) and questioned him with an important air
as if considering the general progress of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do so
Nicholas was in such good spirits that this merely amused him
He indicated the stud farms at which Nicholas might procure horses
Everything seemed to him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in Vorónezh and
After dining and taking rather too much of the Hungarian wine
Nicholas—having exchanged kisses with the landowner
that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the arrival of many wealthy families from Moscow
The society gathered together at the governor’s was the best in Vorónezh
There were a great many ladies and some of Nicholas’ Moscow acquaintances
it seemed to him that everyone regarded the Italian in the same light
diffusing around him a fragrance of perfume and wine
and had uttered the words  better late than never  and heard them repeated several times by others
people clustered around him; all eyes turned on him
who welcomed Rostóv as a near relative and called him  Nicholas
Catherine Petróvna did actually play valses and the écossaise
and dancing began in which Nicholas still further captivated the provincial society by his agility
His particularly free manner of dancing even surprised them all
Nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he danced that evening
He had never danced like that in Moscow and would even have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in bad form
but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by something unusual
something they would have to accept as the regular thing in the capital though new to them in the provinces
With the naïve conviction of young men in a merry mood that other men’s wives were created for them
did not seem to share that conviction and tried to behave morosely with Rostóv
the husband’s became more and more melancholy and solemn
as though there were but a given amount of animation between them and as the wife’s share increased the husband’s diminished
CHAPTER V  Nicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair
bending closely over the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with a smile that never left his face
and the fine outlines of his legs in their well-fitting Hessian boots
Her eyes  (Nicholas looked at his partner)  are blue
The governor’s wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with a blue headdress
the important old lady dismissed Nicholas after repeating her invitation to come to see her
Nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed
When he had parted from Malvíntseva Nicholas wished to return to the dancing
began the governor’s wife with a serious expression on her kind little face
said Nicholas in the simplicity of his heart; it did not enter his head that a pastime so pleasant to himself might not be pleasant to someone else
or his friend) to this woman who was almost a stranger
When he afterwards recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness which had very important results for him
’ Especially if you remember that Mamma had long been thinking of it; but I had never happened to meet her before
somehow it had always happened that we did not meet
And as long as my sister Natásha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of the question for me to think of marrying her
CHAPTER VI  On reaching Moscow after her meeting with Rostóv
Princess Mary had found her nephew there with his tutor
and a letter from Prince Andrew giving her instructions how to get to her Aunt Malvíntseva at Vorónezh
she felt more and more deeply the loss of her father which was associated in her mind with the ruin of Russia
She was worried too about her nephew’s education for which she had always felt herself incompetent
but in the depths of her soul she felt at peace—a peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreams and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and were related to her meeting with Rostóv
and the governor’s wife began to speak of Rostóv in Mary’s presence
praising him and telling how he had blushed when Princess Mary’s name was mentioned
During the two days that elapsed before Rostóv called
Princess Mary continually thought of how she ought to behave to him
Princess Mary imagined the words he would say to her and what she would say to him
and these words sometimes seemed undeservedly cold and then to mean too much
More than anything she feared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as soon as she saw him
and then just as Nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look with shining eyes
she could not have maneuvered better on meeting a man she wished to attract
Had Princess Mary been capable of reflection at that moment
Rostóv saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life
diverting the conversation as soon as her aunt mentioned Andrew
Evidently she could speak of Russia’s misfortunes with a certain artificiality
as he noticed every shade of Princess Mary’s character with an observation unusual to him
and everything confirmed his conviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being
flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with good natured playfulness
As she was in mourning Princess Mary did not go out into society
and Nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again; but all the same the governor’s wife went on with her matchmaking
passing on to Nicholas the flattering things Princess Mary said of him and vice versa
and insisting on his declaring himself to Princess Mary
For this purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at the bishop’s house before Mass
he chose the latter and yielded to the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where
though the course of his life went on externally as before
all his former amusements lost their charm for him and he often thought about her
he had not seen her again himself) to set off in search of Prince Andrew
but everything in Vorónezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome
and he experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness
and often became unreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster
Nicholas went up to her without waiting to be prompted by the governor’s wife and not asking himself whether or not it was right and proper to address her here in church
and told her he had heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul
but cheered by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face
but stayed at home to settle some accounts with the horse dealers
Princess Mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met her in Smolénsk province
His having encountered her in such exceptional circumstances
When he met her again in Vorónezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing but powerful
and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated him and evoked his sympathy
In men Rostóv could not bear to see the expression of a higher spiritual life (that was why he did not like Prince Andrew) and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy and dreaminess
He had long ago pictured to himself a future with Sónya
and that was all clear and simple just because it had all been thought out and he knew all there was in Sónya
but it was impossible to picture a future with Princess Mary
because he did not understand her but simply loved her
Reveries about Sónya had had something merry and playful in them
but one must have faith and not pray as Natásha and I used to as children
and folding his hands placed himself before the icon
Softened by memories of Princess Mary he began to pray as he had not done for a long time
one of which was from his mother and the other from Sónya
He recognized them by the handwriting and opened Sónya’s first
What he had just been praying for with confidence that God would hear him had come to pass; but Nicholas was as much astonished as if it were something extraordinary and unexpected
quite voluntary letter from Sónya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from which there had seemed no escape
had all combined to make her decide to release him from his promise and set him completely free
It would be too painful to me to think that I might be a cause of sorrow or discord in the family that has been so good to me (she wrote)
Next day Nicholas took his mother’s letter and went to see Princess Mary
Neither he nor she said a word about what  Natásha nursing him  might mean
but thanks to this letter Nicholas suddenly became almost as intimate with the princess as if they were relations
was prompted by this: the thought of getting Nicholas married to an heiress occupied the old countess’ mind more and more
She knew that Sónya was the chief obstacle to this happening
and Sónya’s life in the countess’ house had grown harder and harder
especially after they had received a letter from Nicholas telling of his meeting with Princess Mary in Boguchárovo
Sónya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that she would do anything and was prepared for anything
but gave no actual promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded of her
But in all her former acts of self-sacrifice she had been happily conscious that they raised her in her own esteem and in that of others
and so made her more worthy of Nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world
But now they wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the whole reward for her self-sacrifice and the whole meaning of her life
but made others sacrifice themselves for her and yet was beloved by everybody
And for the first time Sónya felt that out of her pure
whose life of dependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive
having answered the countess in vague general terms
avoided talking with her and resolved to wait till she should see Nicholas
not in order to set him free but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever
The bustle and terror of the Rostóvs’ last days in Moscow stifled the gloomy thoughts that oppressed Sónya
She was glad to find escape from them in practical activity
she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that God did not intend her to be separated from Nicholas
She knew that Natásha loved no one but Prince Andrew and had never ceased to love him
She knew that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstances they would again fall in love with one another
and that Nicholas would then not be able to marry Princess Mary as they would be within the prohibited degrees of affinity
Despite all the terror of what had happened during those last days and during the first days of their journey
this feeling that Providence was intervening in her personal affairs cheered Sónya
At the Tróitsa monastery the Rostóvs first broke their journey for a whole day
The wounded man was much better that day and Natásha was sitting with him
In the next room sat the count and countess respectfully conversing with the prior
tormented by curiosity as to what Prince Andrew and Natásha were talking about
the two friends went together to Prince Andrew’s door
Natásha softly closed the door and went with Sónya to the window
making a gesture with her hand and a lifted finger at each detail
convincing herself that the details she had just seen were exactly what she had seen in the mirror
She had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing that came into her head
but what she had invented then seemed to her now as real as any other recollection
who now thought she too remembered the word pink being used
remained at the window thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred
especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her vision
Now that she knew that the renewal of Natásha’s relations with Prince Andrew would prevent Nicholas from marrying Princess Mary
she was joyfully conscious of a return of that self-sacrificing spirit in which she was accustomed to live and loved to live
So with a joyful consciousness of performing a magnanimous deed—interrupted several times by the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyes—she wrote that touching letter the arrival of which had so amazed Nicholas
Pierre felt that for the new guard—both officers and men—he was not as interesting as he had been to his captors; and in fact the guard of the second day did not recognize in this big
In spite of this he was placed that day with the other arrested suspects
as the separate room he had occupied was required by an officer
On the third day he was taken with the others to a house where a French general with a white mustache sat with two colonels and other Frenchmen with scarves on their arms
shut out the possibility of that essence’s being revealed
As soon as Pierre began to say anything that did not fit in with that aim
perplexity as to why these questions were put to him
that force alone gave them the right to demand answers to their questions
this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary
Why was he in the yard of a burning house where witnesses had seen him
He replied that he had gone out to see what was happening in Moscow
sternly remarked the general with the white mustache and red flushed face
On the fourth day fires broke out on the Zúbovski rampart
Pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a merchant’s house near the Crimean bridge
naming Pierre as  the man who does not give his name
Glancing indolently and indifferently at all the prisoners
he ordered the officer in charge to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the marshal
and all Moscow as far as Pierre could see was one vast charred ruin
On all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing
and here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses
Pierre gazed at the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well
gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the belfry of Iván the Great
The domes of the New Convent of the Virgin glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly
These bells reminded Pierre that it was Sunday and the feast of the Nativity of the Virgin
But there seemed to be no one to celebrate this holiday: everywhere were blackened ruins
and the few Russians to be seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw the French
It was plain that the Russian nest was ruined and destroyed
He felt it in the merry sounds of regimental music he heard from the left side of the field
and felt and realized it especially from the list of prisoners the French officer had read out when he came that morning
they were now leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted and that they were being taken to the proper place
Pierre felt himself to be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose action he did not understand but which was working well
He and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the Virgin’s Field
as he sat like a stern schoolmaster who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer
Pierre felt that every instant of delay might cost him his life; but he did not know what to say
He did not venture to repeat what he had said at his first examination
that look established human relations between the two men
At that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their minds
faltering voice Pierre began adducing proofs of the truth of his statements
But at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to Davout
he jerked his head in Pierre’s direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away
But where they were to take him Pierre did not know: back to the coach house or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him as they crossed the Virgin’s Field
and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others did till they all stopped and he stopped too
The only thought in his mind at that time was: who was it that had really sentenced him to death
In another moment Davout would have realized that he was doing wrong
as far as a kitchen garden in which a post had been set up
Beyond that post a fresh pit had been dug in the ground
and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood in a semicircle
Several drums suddenly began to beat on both sides of them
And he had only one wish—that the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly
There was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident that they were all hurrying—not as men hurry to do something they understand
but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and incomprehensible task
A French official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of prisoners and read out the sentence in Russian and in French
Then two pairs of Frenchmen approached the criminals and at the officer’s command took the two convicts who stood first in the row
Twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firm regular tread and halted eight paces from the post
these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for protection in their eyes
evidently unable to understand or believe what was going to happen to them
They could not believe it because they alone knew what their life meant to them
and so they neither understood nor believed that it could be taken from them
The same question was expressed in all the looks that met his
The fifth man was the factory lad in the loose cloak
and like a wounded animal looked around him with glittering eyes
Like the others this fifth man seemed calm; he wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other
Pierre did not take his eyes from him and did not miss his slightest movement
Probably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports of eight muskets; but try as he would Pierre could not afterwards remember having heard the slightest sound of the shots
frightened people were doing something around the workman
The soldiers dragged it awkwardly from the post and began pushing it into the pit
They all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible
Pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other
That shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively
and the rows of troops on both sides of the post made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace
ran back to their places as the companies passed by
noncommissioned officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him to his company
The crowd of Russians and Frenchmen began to disperse
Without finishing what he had begun to say he made a hopeless movement with his arm and went away
In the darkness some twenty different men surrounded Pierre
on which everything depended and which made everything appear alive
and at the bottom of his heart he had felt that relief from his despair and from those doubts was to be found within himself
He felt that it was not in his power to regain faith in the meaning of life
Around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something about him interested them greatly
Sitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall
Pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes
And he opened his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around him
Beside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence he was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came from him every time he moved
This man was doing something to his legs in the darkness
and though Pierre could not see his face he felt that the man continually glanced at him
Having unwound the string that tied the band on one leg
having carefully removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following one another uninterruptedly
And there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voice that Pierre tried to reply
we peasants lived well and our house was one to thank God for
Sounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance outside
listening to the regular snoring of Platón who lay beside him
and two officials were confined in the shed in which Pierre had been placed and where he remained for four weeks
When Pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures to him except Platón Karatáev
strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he laughed—as he often did—were all sound and good
there was not a gray hair in his beard or on his head
But the chief peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness
It was evident that he never considered what he had said or was going to say
and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had an irresistible persuasiveness
and only at night allowed himself conversation—of which he was fond—and songs
Having been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow
and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during the whole of his army service
were for the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers employ
but those folk sayings which taken without a context seem so insignificant
but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance of profound wisdom
adorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings which Pierre thought he invented himself
but the chief charm of his talk lay in the fact that the commonest events—sometimes just such as Pierre had witnessed without taking notice of them—assumed in Karatáev’s a character of solemn fitness
He liked to hear the folk tales one of the soldiers used to tell of an evening (they were always the same)
but most of all he liked to hear stories of real life
He would smile joyfully when listening to such stories
but Pierre felt that in spite of Karatáev’s affectionate tenderness for him (by which he unconsciously gave Pierre’s spiritual life its due) he would not have grieved for a moment at parting from him
And Pierre began to feel in the same way toward Karatáev
eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and truth
Platón Karatáev knew nothing by heart except his prayers
but Platón could never recall what he had said a moment before
understand the meaning of words apart from their context
and spontaneously as fragrance exhales from a flower
He could not understand the value or significance of any word or deed taken separately
CHAPTER XIV  When Princess Mary heard from Nicholas that her brother was with the Rostóvs at Yaroslávl she at once prepared to go there
and a young footman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany her
The usual route through Moscow could not be thought of
and near Ryazán where the French were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous
and Princess Mary’s servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of spirit
they approached Yaroslávl by the end of the second week
The last days of her stay in Vorónezh had been the happiest of her life
Latterly she had become convinced that she loved and was beloved
though she never said this definitely to herself in words
She had become convinced of it at her last interview with Nicholas
when he had come to tell her that her brother was with the Rostóvs
but it sometimes seemed to Princess Mary that he was even glad that the family connection between them allowed him to express his friendship more freely
But this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent her feeling grief for her brother with full force; on the contrary
that spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her to give full play to her feeling for her brother
But as she approached Yaroslávl the thought of what might await her there—not after many days
but that very evening—again presented itself to her and her agitation increased to its utmost limit
Princess Mary looked at him with frightened inquiry
What  still the same  might mean Princess Mary did not ask
but with an unnoticed glance at little seven-year-old Nicholas
who was sitting in front of her looking with pleasure at the town
and the princess found herself in the hall facing an elderly woman of Oriental type
and the old count came in and welcomed the princess
While talking to Princess Mary he continually looked round as if asking everyone whether he was doing the right thing
After the destruction of Moscow and of his property
thrown out of his accustomed groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own significance and to feel that there was no longer a place for him in life
In spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible
and her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him they should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephew
Tears of vexation showed themselves in Princess Mary’s eyes
The princess looked round and saw Natásha coming in
almost running—that Natásha whom she had liked so little at their meeting in Moscow long since
she softly left his room and hastened to her with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to Princess Mary
and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them
but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say all she knew or not; she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes which penetrated into the very depths of her heart
Natásha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverish condition and the pain he suffered
she knew that she would be unable to look at him without tears
The princess understood what Natásha had meant by the words:  two days ago this suddenly happened
She understood those words to mean that he had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signs of approaching death
tender words to her such as her father had uttered before his death
and again making an evident effort to be affectionate
Evidently only with an effort did he understand anything living; but it was obvious that he failed to understand
Prince Andrew did not notice that she called his sister Mary
as if pleased at having found words he had long been seeking
Princess Mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her
he understood that she was crying at the thought that little Nicholas would be left without a father
but had he possessed all the faculties he afterwards acquired
rosy upper lip trembled and leaning his head against her he began to cry
After that he avoided Dessalles and the countess who caressed him and either sat alone or came timidly to Princess Mary
When Princess Mary had left Prince Andrew she fully understood what Natásha’s face had told her
whose presence above the dying man was now so evident
CHAPTER XVI  Not only did Prince Andrew know he would die
but he felt that he was dying and was already half dead
He was conscious of an aloofness from everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existence
He had twice experienced that terribly tormenting fear of death—the end—but now he no longer understood that fear
When he came to himself after being wounded and the flower of eternal
unfettered love had instantly unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of life that had restrained it
the more deeply he penetrated into the new principle of eternal love revealed to him
the more he unconsciously detached himself from earthly life
And the more imbued he became with that principle of love
the more he renounced life and the more completely he destroyed that dreadful barrier which—in the absence of such love—stands between life and death
love for a particular woman again crept unobserved into his heart and once more bound him to life
And joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind
She had learned to knit stockings since Prince Andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as old nurses who knit stockings
He looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a deep breath after stooping
but refrained from doing so and breathed cautiously
At the Tróitsa monastery they had spoken of the past
he now thought as he looked at her and listened to the light click of the steel needles
He did not sleep long and suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration
But just when he was clumsily creeping toward the door
that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in
And all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision
she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more convincing
From that day an awakening from life came to Prince Andrew together with his awakening from sleep
And compared to the duration of life it did not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the duration of a dream
There was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow awakening
They did not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt that they were not attending on him (he was no longer there
he had left them) but on what reminded them most closely of him—his body
Both felt this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did not affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their grief
They felt that they could not express in words what they understood
everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept
Little Nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexity
The countess and Sónya cried from pity for Natásha and because he was no more
but not because of their own personal grief; they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in their presence
BOOK THIRTEEN: 1812      CHAPTER I  Man’s mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness
but the desire to find those causes is implanted in man’s soul
And without considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one of which taken separately may seem to be the cause
he snatches at the first approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says:  This is the cause
the will of those who stood in the most prominent position—the heroes of history
But we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic event—which lies in the activity of the general mass of men who take part in it—to be convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the actions of the mass but is itself continually controlled
It may seem to be a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of historical events this way or that; yet there is the same difference between a man who says that the people of the West moved on the East because Napoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened because it had to happen
as there is between those who declared that the earth was stationary and that the planets moved round it and those who admitted that they did not know what upheld the earth
and some of these laws are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend
The discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quite abandoned the attempt to find the cause in the will of some one man
next to the battle of Borodinó and the occupation of Moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire
the most important episode of the war of 1812 was the movement of the Russian army from the Ryazána to the Kalúga road and to the Tarútino camp—the so-called flank march across the Krásnaya Pakhrá River
consider this flank march to be the profound conception of some one man who saved Russia and destroyed Napoleon
In the first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and genius of this movement lay
for not much mental effort was needed to see that the best position for an army when it is not being attacked is where there are most provisions; and even a dull boy of thirteen could have guessed that the best position for an army after its retreat from Moscow in 1812 was on the Kalúga road
So it is impossible to understand by what reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver was a profound one
might have proved ruinous to the Russians and salutary for the French
If the position of the Russian army really began to improve from the time of that march
it does not at all follow that the march was the cause of it
That flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to the Russian army
but might in other circumstances have led to its destruction
If the Russian army at Krásnaya Pakhrá had given battle as Bennigsen and Barclay advised
What would have happened had the French attacked the Russians while they were marching beyond the Pakhrá
What would have happened if on approaching Tarútino
Napoleon had attacked the Russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he attacked them at Smolénsk
In any of these eventualities the flank march that brought salvation might have proved disastrous
event by event—from an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was only seen in its entirety when it had been accomplished and belonged to the past
In proof of this there is the fact that the majority of the council voted for such a retreat
Lanskóy informed the commander in chief that the army supplies were for the most part stored along the Oká in the Túla and Ryazán provinces
and above all the abundance of provisions in Kalúga province
obliged our army to turn still more to the south and to cross from the Túla to the Kalúga road and go to Tarútino
which was between the roads along which those supplies lay
did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired this movement and long ago foreseen its result
was naturally drawn toward the district where supplies were abundant
it could not have done anything but make a return movement toward Moscow
and Kalúga roads was so natural that even the Russian marauders moved in that direction
and demands were sent from Petersburg for Kutúzov to take his army that way
At Tarútino Kutúzov received what was almost a reprimand from the Emperor for having moved his army along the Ryazán road
and the Emperor’s letter indicated to him the very position he had already occupied near Kalúga
Having rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the whole campaign and by the battle of Borodinó
but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of what had happened
He alone then understood the meaning of the French army’s inactivity
he alone continued to assert that the battle of Borodinó had been a victory
he alone—who as commander in chief might have been expected to be eager to attack—employed his whole strength to restrain the Russian army from useless engagements
with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was right
But he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his troops from attacking
During the month that the French troops were pillaging in Moscow and the Russian troops were quietly encamped at Tarútino
a change had taken place in the relative strength of the two armies—both in spirit and in number—as a result of which the superiority had passed to the Russian side
Though the condition and numbers of the French army were unknown to the Russians
as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking at once showed itself by countless signs
These signs were: Lauriston’s mission; the abundance of provisions at Tarútino; the reports coming in from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the French; the flow of recruits to our regiments; the fine weather; the long rest the Russian soldiers had enjoyed
and the impatience to do what they had been assembled for
was doing; the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to the French stationed at Tarútino; the news of easy successes gained by peasants and guerrilla troops over the French
the envy aroused by this; the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every Russian as long as the French were in Moscow
and (above all) a dim consciousness in every soldier’s mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and that the advantage was now on our side
Before the news of the abandonment of Moscow had been received in Petersburg
a detailed plan of the whole campaign had been drawn up and sent to Kutúzov for his guidance
Though this plan had been drawn up on the supposition that Moscow was still in our hands
it was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action
Kutúzov only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always difficult to execute
So fresh instructions were sent for the solution of difficulties that might be encountered
and so on—as if anything more than A’s or B’s satisfaction depended on this
and so on in all possible combinations and permutations
In all these plottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conduct of the war
and during all this time not only has no action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancient capital
but according to your last report you have even retreated farther
I see that an enemy corps of ten thousand men is moving on the Petersburg road
rather considerable detachment is stationed between Rúza and Mozháysk
retaining in our hands an important part of the provinces now occupied by the enemy
and thereby averting danger from Túla and other towns in the interior
The state of things on the staff had of late been exceedingly strained
Ermólov had been to see Bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to use his influence with the commander in chief to induce him to take the offensive
If I did not know you I should think you did not want what you are asking for
Kutúzov—having taken into consideration the Cossack’s report
and the fact that all the generals expressed the same wish—could no longer check the inevitable movement
all these columns arrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy
not a single column reached its place at the appointed time
When the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been prepared
The officer searched till six o’clock in the evening without even stopping to eat
The officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a moment he was doubly to blame
with an unpleasant consciousness of having to direct a battle he did not approve of
not because that officer was to blame for the mistake
but because he was an object of sufficient importance for him to vent his wrath on
a Serene Highness who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever had in Russia
to be placed in this position—made the laughingstock of the whole army
I needn’t have been in such a hurry to pray about today
He was in a state of physical suffering as if from corporal punishment
but the majority marched all night and arrived at places where they evidently should not have been
Only Count Orlóv-Denísov with his Cossacks (the least important detachment of all) got to his appointed place at the right time
This detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest
He said that Murat was spending the night less than a mile from where they were
said Count Orlóv-Denísov to the sergeant at parting
now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dying campfires
As often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before our eyes
Fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty-eight guns were taken on the spot
though not to their right places; a few eventually even got to their right place
Thus he stumbled on Bagovút’s corps in a wood when it was already broad daylight
though the corps should long before have joined Orlóv-Denísov
Excited and vexed by the failure and supposing that someone must be responsible for it
And his division remained under fire for some time quite uselessly
He well knew that nothing but confusion would come of this battle undertaken against his will
but you don’t see that we are unable to execute complicated maneuvers
said he to Milorádovich who asked permission to advance
When Kutúzov was informed that at the French rear—where according to the reports of the Cossacks there had previously been nobody—there were now two battalions of Poles
They are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds
Ermólov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these words
He understood that for him the storm had blown over
Ermólov moved up to Kutúzov and respectfully remarked:   It is not too late yet
but when they reported to him that Murat’s troops were in retreat he ordered an advance
though at every hundred paces he halted for three quarters of an hour
The whole battle consisted in what Orlóv-Denísov’s Cossacks had done: the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly
In consequence of this battle Kutúzov received a diamond decoration
and Bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles
others also received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various grades
said the Russian officers and generals after the Tarútino battle
A countless number of free forces (for nowhere is man freer than during a battle
where it is a question of life and death) influence the course taken by the fight
and that course never can be known in advance and never coincides with the direction of any one force
If many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a given body
the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of those forces
we find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previously formed plans
the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptions are false
The battle of Tarútino obviously did not attain the aim Toll had in view—to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the dispositions; nor that which Count Orlóv-Denísov may have had in view—to take Murat prisoner; nor the result of immediately destroying the whole corps
was exactly what was wanted at that stage of the campaign
and the administration of that shock which Napoleon’s army had only awaited to begin its flight
CHAPTER VIII  Napoleon enters Moscow after the brilliant victory de la Moskowa; there can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the hands of the French
He can either fall on the Russian army with double its strength and destroy it; negotiate an advantageous peace
return to Smolénsk or Vílna; or remain in Moscow; in short
only very simple and easy steps were necessary: not to allow the troops to loot
to prepare winter clothing—of which there was sufficient in Moscow for the whole army—and methodically to collect the provisions
but on the contrary he used his power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open to him
or retiring by a more northerly or more southerly route (say by the road Kutúzov afterwards took)
again without attempting to break through and take the road Kutúzov took
but retiring instead to Mozháysk along the devastated Smolénsk road
the most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series of actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose
having no more force than the personal activity of any soldier
merely coincided with the laws that guided the event
The historians quite falsely represent Napoleon’s faculties as having weakened in Moscow
and do so only because the results did not justify his actions
He employed all his ability and strength to do the best he could for himself and his army
as he had done previously and as he did subsequently in 1813
We do not know for certain in how far his genius was genuine in Egypt—where forty centuries looked down upon his grandeur—for his great exploits there are all told us by Frenchmen
We cannot accurately estimate his genius in Austria or Prussia
for we have to draw our information from French or German sources
have no need to recognize his genius in order to hide our shame
His activity in Moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as elsewhere
Then he gave careful directions about the fortification of the Krémlin
who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how to get out of Moscow
minutely explained to him his whole policy and his magnanimity
Having similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to Tutólmin
immediately after the fires he gave orders to find and execute the incendiaries
but His Majesty the Emperor and King desires to arrest their course
Terrible examples have taught you how he punishes disobedience and crime
Its members will be distinguished by a red ribbon worn across the shoulder
and the mayor of the city will wear a white belt as well
But when not on duty they will only wear a red ribbon round the left arm
The city police is established on its former footing
and better order already prevails in consequence of its activity
and twenty commissaries or captains of wards have been appointed to the different wards of the city
You will recognize them by the white ribbon they will wear on the left arm
Your fellow citizens are returning every day to their homes and orders have been given that they should find in them the help and protection due to their misfortunes
These are the measures the government has adopted to re-establish order and relieve your condition
should be certain that inevitable and ignominious death awaits those who make any attempt on your persons or on what remains of your property
and finally that you should not doubt that these will be safeguarded
Napoleon decreed that all the troops in turn should enter Moscow à la maraude   to obtain provisions for themselves
Napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back and services to be again performed in the churches
With regard to commerce and to provisioning the army
Tranquillity is returning to this capital and order is being restored in it
Your fellow countrymen are emerging boldly from their hiding places on finding that they are respected
and considers no one among you his enemy except those who disobey his orders
Markets are established in the city where peasants can bring their surplus supplies and the products of the soil
and those living in the neighborhood of Moscow may without any danger bring their supplies of all kinds to two appointed markets
of which one is on the Mokhováya Street and the other at the Provision Market
(2) Such supplies will be bought from them at such prices as seller and buyer may agree on
and if a seller is unable to obtain a fair price he will be free to take his goods back to his village and no one may hinder him under any pretense
(3) Sunday and Wednesday of each week are appointed as the chief market days and to that end a sufficient number of troops will be stationed along the highroads on Tuesdays and Saturdays at such distances from the town as to protect the carts
(4) Similar measures will be taken that peasants with their carts and horses may meet with no hindrance on their return journey
you are called on to carry out the paternal intentions of His Majesty the Emperor and King and to co-operate with him for the public welfare
Lay your respect and confidence at his feet and do not delay to unite with us
With the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of the people
reviews were constantly held and rewards distributed
He caused the words Maison de ma Mère to be inscribed on the charitable institutions
he ordered his soldiers to be paid in forged Russian money which he had prepared:  Raising the use of these means by an act worthy of himself and of the French army
he let relief be distributed to those who had been burned out
and plans—which were not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstances—did not affect the essence of the matter but
like the hands of a clock detached from the mechanism
swung about in an arbitrary and aimless way without engaging the cogwheels
Fain to prove that this work of genius must be referred not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of October—that plan never was or could be executed
The French generals lost touch with the Russian army of sixty thousand men
all Napoleon’s arguments as to his magnanimity and justice
both to Tutólmin and to Yákovlev (whose chief concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance)
Two or three priests who were found in Moscow did try to carry out Napoleon’s wish
but one of them was slapped in the face by a French soldier while conducting service
and the peasants caught the commissaries who ventured too far out of town with the proclamation and killed them
But the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given by the authorities at that time was Napoleon’s attempt to stop the looting and re-establish discipline
This is what the army authorities were reporting:   Looting continues in the city despite the decrees against it
The neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of the 3rd Corps who
not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left
There is a band of thieves in our district who ought to be arrested by a strong force—October 11
The Emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to stop pillage
parties of marauding Guards are continually seen returning to the Krémlin
carry disobedience to such a point that they break into the cellars and stores containing army supplies
complains bitterly that in spite of repeated orders
like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot the provender which might have saved it from starvation
evoked in him a desire to punish the Russians (Thiers says)
and he issued the order for departure which the whole army was demanding
And yet with his experience of war he did not order all the superfluous vehicles to be burned
as he had done with those of a certain marshal when approaching Moscow
He gazed at the calèches and carriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a very good thing
The plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing
CHAPTER XI  Early in the morning of the sixth of October Pierre went out of the shed
now bask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance
and now frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a straw
Pierre’s attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt (the only remnant of his former clothing)
though he still had the appearance of solidity and strength hereditary in his family
then at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about biting him
Every time he looked at his bare feet a smile of animated self-satisfaction flitted across his face
The sight of them reminded him of all he had experienced and learned during these weeks and this recollection was pleasant to him
and that warmth was particularly pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in the air
all stood out in the transparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearness
Near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a half-burned mansion occupied by the French
with lilac bushes still showing dark green beside the fence
And the corporal leaned against the door and offered Pierre his pipe
and Pierre told the corporal that something should be done about him
The corporal replied that Pierre need not worry about that as they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital and arrangements would be made for the sick
(The affair he had alluded to had happened a few days before—a fight between the prisoners and the French soldiers
in which Pierre had succeeded in pacifying his comrades
Some of the prisoners who had heard Pierre talking to the corporal immediately asked what the Frenchman had said
tattered French soldier came up to the door of the shed
Rapidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by way of greeting
he asked Pierre whether the soldier Platoche to whom he had given a shirt to sew was in that shed
A week before the French had had boot leather and linen issued to them
on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work
Karatáev thanked the Frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work
and thanks especially to the fact that the privations came so gradually that it was impossible to say when they began
he endured his position not only lightly but joyfully
And just at this time he obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reach
He had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind
and in romantic love for Natásha; he had sought it by reasoning—and all these quests and experiments had failed him
It was plain to him that all these things were no business of his
repeating words of Karatáev’s which he found strangely consoling
His intention of killing Napoleon and his calculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the Apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous
His anger with his wife and anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed not merely trivial but even amusing
whether or not they found out that their prisoner’s name was Count Bezúkhov
He now often remembered his conversation with Prince Andrew and quite agreed with him
though he understood Prince Andrew’s thoughts somewhat differently
Prince Andrew had thought and said that happiness could only be negative
but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony as though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is implanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied
now seemed to Pierre to be indubitably man’s highest happiness
of his way of life—now that that was so restricted—seemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a superfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying one’s needs
and his social position had given him in his own life—is just what makes the choice of occupation insolubly difficult and destroys the desire and possibility of having an occupation
and the wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance
when he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of the crows flying from Moscow across the field
all began to sparkle in the glad light—Pierre felt a new joy and strength in life such as he had never before known
And this not only stayed with him during the whole of his imprisonment
but even grew in strength as the hardships of his position increased
his readiness to give anything asked of him (he received the allowance of three rubles a week made to officers); with his strength
which he showed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut; his gentleness to his companions
and his capacity for sitting still and thinking without doing anything (which seemed to them incomprehensible)
his absent-mindedness and simplicity—here among these people gave him almost the status of a hero
And Pierre felt that their opinion placed responsibilities upon him
girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes Karatáev had made for him from some leather a French soldier had torn off a tea chest and brought to have his boots mended with
the corporal who had offered him a pipe the day before came up to it with two soldiers
But even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal he knew or a stranger
and Pierre understood that this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that it was now useless to say any more
who was wearing a Kazán dressing gown tied round with a towel
conjecturing where they were now being taken and how far they would get that day
An official in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from side to side and gazed at the ruins of Moscow
Pierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked these exclamations
and dimly made out something leaning against the palings surrounding the church
drove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at the dead man
CHAPTER XIV  Through the cross streets of the Khamóvniki quarter the prisoners marched
followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons belonging to that escort
endless rows of troops and carts stretched away into the distance
were crossing the Crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the Kalúga road
But the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of Beauharnais’ train had not yet got out of Moscow and reached the Kalúga road when the vanguard of Ney’s army was already emerging from the Great Ordýnka Street
and from all sides vehicles and men crowded closer and closer together
and came out upon the square where the streets of the Transmoskvá ward and the Kalúga road converge
Pierre stood pressed against the wall of a charred house
saw over the heads of the others what so attracted their curiosity
From the moment Pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysterious force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful: neither the corpse smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burned ruins of Moscow
Pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement
All these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible power
ever the same words of abuse flew from side to side
and all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute and coldly cruel expression that had struck Pierre that morning on the corporal’s face when the drums were beating
A carriage that followed the escort ran into one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole
now that they had stopped amid fields in the chill dusk of the autumn evening
experienced one and the same feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push on that had seized them at the start
Once at a standstill they all seemed to understand that they did not yet know where they were going
and that much that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey
During this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they had done at the start
It was here that the prisoners for the first time received horseflesh for their meat ration
From the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like personal spite against each of the prisoners
Pierre saw a Frenchman beat a Russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from the road
and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to court-martial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the Russian
To the noncommissioned officer’s excuse that the prisoner was ill and could not walk
the officer replied that the order was to shoot those who lagged behind
but he felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush him
there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent of it
He ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his comrades
Neither Pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen in Moscow
or of the roughness of their treatment by the French
or of the order to shoot them which had been announced to them
A red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the rising full moon
endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet
and went and lay down to sleep beside his companions
CHAPTER XV  In the early days of October another envoy came to Kutúzov with a letter from Napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from Moscow
though Napoleon was already not far from Kutúzov on the old Kalúga road
which turned out to be a most difficult and important one
saving what was possible when all were flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rear guard
when Bagratión was killed and nine tenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the French artillery fire was directed against it
and Borodinó became the greatest glory of the Russian army
It was Dokhtúrov again whom they sent to Formínsk and from there to Málo-Yaroslávets
the place where the last battle with the French was fought and where the obvious disintegration of the French army began; and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the campaign
but of Dokhtúrov nothing or very little is said and that dubiously
And this silence about Dokhtúrov is the clearest testimony to his merit
It is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance and is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most important part
The man who does not understand the construction of the machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which revolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine
and not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working
On the tenth of October when Dokhtúrov had gone halfway to Formínsk and stopped at the village of Aristóvo
the two small guerrilla detachments of Figner and Seslávin
On the evening of October 11 Seslávin came to the Aristóvo headquarters with a French guardsman he had captured
The prisoner said that the troops that had entered Formínsk that day were the vanguard of the whole army
that Napoleon was there and the whole army had left Moscow four days previously
That same evening a house serf who had come from Bórovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town
Some Cossacks of Dokhtúrov’s detachment reported having sighted the French Guards marching along the road to Bórovsk
having received the dispatch and verbal instructions
Bolkhovítinov reached Litashëvka after one o’clock at night
said he to someone who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage
entering the open door which he had found by feeling in the dark
unable to see in the dark who was speaking but guessing by the voice that it was not Konovnítsyn
knowing that those words would be sure to arouse him
there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote from present affairs
While listening to the officer’s report Konovnítsyn broke the seal and read the dispatch
Konovnítsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great importance and that no time must be lost
He regarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or his reason but by something else
There was within him a deep unexpressed conviction that all would be well
Like Dokhtúrov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacity and information
and like Dokhtúrov he never made plans of battle but was always found where the situation was most difficult
Since his appointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door open
so that Kutúzov reproved him for it and feared to send him to the front
dark night Konovnítsyn frowned—partly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the unpleasant thought that occurred to him
Kutúzov was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements
Like an experienced sportsman he knew that the beast was wounded
and wounded as only the whole strength of Russia could have wounded it
but whether it was mortally wounded or not was still an undecided question
And what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me
On the other Kutúzov felt assured with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all the Russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal
But in any case proofs were needed; he had waited a whole month for them and grew more impatient the longer he waited
that he saw thousands of contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them
The longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves
He thought too of the possibility (which he feared most of all) that Napoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in Moscow awaiting him
Kutúzov even imagined that Napoleon’s army might turn back through Medýn and Yukhnóv
but the one thing he could not foresee was what happened—the insane
which seemed important to the younger men but not to Kutúzov
With his sixty years’ experience he knew what value to attach to rumors
knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all news so that it appears to confirm what they desire
and he knew how readily in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary
To such customary routine belonged his conversations with the staff
On the night of the eleventh of October he lay leaning on his arm and thinking of that
Kutúzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big paunch resting against the other which was doubled under him
He screwed up his seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully
but his face suddenly puckered and wrinkled; he waved his arm at Toll and turned to the opposite side of the room
but the enemy without waiting for his retreat fled in the opposite direction
Napoleon’s historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at Tarútino and Málo-Yaroslávets
and make conjectures as to what would have happened had Napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southern provinces
But not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancing into those southern provinces (for the Russian army did not bar his way)
the historians forget that nothing could have saved his army
for then already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable ruin
How could that army—which had found abundant supplies in Moscow and had trampled them underfoot instead of keeping them
and on arriving at Smolénsk had looted provisions instead of storing them—how could that army recuperate in Kalúga province
which was inhabited by Russians such as those who lived in Moscow
The members of what had once been an army—Napoleon himself and all his soldiers fled—without knowing whither
each concerned only to make his escape as quickly as possible from this position
of the hopelessness of which they were all more or less vaguely conscious
So it came about that at the council at Málo-Yaroslávets
when the generals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions
could say anything against that truth which they all recognized
But though they all realized that it was necessary to get away
there still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee
It was what the French called  le hourra de l’Empereur
The day after the council at Málo-Yaroslávets Napoleon rode out early in the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and an escort
on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the previous and of the impending battle
Disregarding Napoleon they rushed after the plunder and Napoleon managed to escape
When les enfants du Don might so easily have taken the Emperor himself in the midst of his army
but that the forces which influenced the whole army and directed it along the Mozháysk (that is
the Smolénsk) road acted simultaneously on him also
CHAPTER XIX  A man in motion always devises an aim for that motion
To be able to go a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the end of those thousand miles
One must have the prospect of a promised land to have the strength to move
and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutely necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself:  Today I shall get to a place twenty-five miles off where I shall rest and spend the night
and during the first day’s journey that resting place eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires
And the impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd
It was not that they knew that much food and fresh troops awaited them in Smolénsk
but because this alone could give them strength to move on and endure their present privations
Coming out onto the highroad the French fled with surprising energy and unheard-of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on
Besides the common impulse which bound the whole crowd of French into one mass and supplied them with a certain energy
their enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself
In their hundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nation
drew each of them in the same direction; on the other hand an army corps could not surrender to a company
Their very numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that possibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the Russians to stop this movement
to which the French were directing all their energies
There is a certain limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow
On the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snow becomes
Of the Russian commanders Kutúzov alone understood this
When the flight of the French army along the Smolénsk road became well defined
what Konovnítsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of October began to occur
when a third of their army has melted away on the road from Moscow to Vyázma without any battle
and others in proximity to the French near Vyázma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up two French corps
BOOK FOURTEEN: 1812      CHAPTER I  The Battle of Borodinó
with the occupation of Moscow that followed it and the flight of the French without further conflicts
is one of the most instructive phenomena in history
All historians agree that the external activity of states and nations in their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars
and that as a direct result of greater or less success in war the political strength of states and nations increases or decreases
and subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions
and at once a people loses its rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse
and if its army suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated
To strain the facts to fit the rules of history: to say that the field of battle at Borodinó remained in the hands of the Russians
If it were an example taken from the history of China
we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon (which is the historians’ usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards); if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number of troops took part
we might treat it as an exception; but this event occurred before our fathers’ eyes
for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the French have it
The victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants Karp and Vlas (who after the French had evacuated Moscow drove in their carts to pillage the town
and in general personally failed to manifest any heroic feelings)
and the whole innumerable multitude of such peasants
Let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers according to all the rules of the art of fencing
The fencing has gone on for some time; suddenly one of the combatants
and seizing the first cudgel that comes to hand begins to brandish it
insisted that he had gained his victory with the rapier according to all the rules of art
One can imagine what confusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel
The fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was the French army; his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up the cudgel was the Russian people; those who try to explain the matter according to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described the event
and from the time he took up the correct fencing attitude in Moscow and instead of his opponent’s rapier saw a cudgel raised above his head
he did not cease to complain to Kutúzov and to the Emperor Alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all the rules—as if there were any rules for killing people
In spite of the complaints of the French as to the nonobservance of the rules
and so on—the cudgel of the people’s war was lifted with all its menacing and majestic strength
and belabored the French till the whole invasion had perished
without asking what rules others have adopted in similar cases
simply and easily pick up the first cudgel that comes to hand and strike with it till the feeling of resentment and revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of contempt and compassion
CHAPTER II  One of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the so-called laws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressed together in a mass
People have called this kind of war  guerrilla warfare  and assume that by so calling it they have explained its meaning
But such a war does not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a well-known rule of tactics which is accepted as infallible
This contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumes the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers
For military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanics by reference to the mass only: stating that momenta are equal or unequal to each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal
Momentum (quantity of motion) is the product of mass and velocity
seeing in history innumerable instances of the fact that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and that small detachments defeat larger ones
But the assignment of these various meanings to the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic facts
with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute
Men who want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous conditions for fighting
The spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass gives the resulting force
To define and express the significance of this unknown factor—the spirit of an army—is a problem for science
and so on—mistaking these for the real significance of the factor
This equation does not give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between two unknowns
a series of numbers could be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be discovered
unconsciously confirms the truth that the strength of an army depends on its spirit
To lead men forward under fire more discipline (obtainable only by movement in masses) is needed than is needed to resist attacks
dealt blows at the French without needing any compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and dangers
CHAPTER III  The so-called partisan war began with the entry of the French into Smolénsk
and foragers had been destroyed by the Cossacks and the peasants
was the first to recognize the value of this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military science destroyed the French
and to him belongs the credit for taking the first step toward regularizing this method of warfare
On August 24 Davýdov’s first partisan detachment was formed and then others were recognized
There were also small scratch groups of foot and horse
and groups of peasants and landowners that remained unknown
The partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of October
hardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued
The small bands that had started their activities long before and had already observed the French closely considered things possible which the commanders of the big detachments did not dare to contemplate
Denísov (who was one of the irregulars) was with his group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm
Since early morning he and his party had been on the move
All day long he had been watching from the forest that skirted the highroad a large French convoy of cavalry baggage and Russian prisoners separated from the rest of the army
which—as was learned from spies and prisoners—was moving under a strong escort to Smolénsk
Besides Denísov and Dólokhov (who also led a small party and moved in Denísov’s vicinity)
Two of the commanders of large parties—one a Pole and the other a German—sent invitations to Denísov almost simultaneously
despite his heartfelt desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general
he had to forgo that pleasure because he was already under the command of the Polish general
To the Polish general he replied to the same effect
to attack and seize that convoy with their own small forces
On October 22 it was moving from the village of Mikúlino to that of Shámshevo
To the left of the road between Mikúlino and Shámshevo there were large forests
extending in some places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more back from it
Through these forests Denísov and his party rode all day
Cossacks of Denísov’s party had seized and carried off into the forest two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles
the party had watched the movements of the French without attacking
It was necessary to let the French reach Shámshevo quietly without alarming them and then
more than a mile from Mikúlino where the forest came right up to the road
to find out at what distance there were other French troops
That morning’s attack on the wagons had been made so hastily that the Frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed; only a little drummer boy had been taken alive
and as he was a straggler he could tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column
with narrow light eyes and with calm self-satisfaction in his face and bearing
Though it was impossible to say in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay
yet at first glance at the esaul and Denísov one saw that the latter was wet and uncomfortable and was a man mounted on a horse
and raising his eyebrows gazed about him with surprise
In the midst of the outspread line of Cossacks two wagons
drawn by French horses and by saddled Cossack horses that had been hitched on in front
rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and splashed through the water that lay in the ruts
Denísov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger (none of them had eaten anything since morning)
and yet more because he still had no news from Dólokhov and the man sent to capture a  tongue  had not returned
who was fond of using words the Cossacks did not know
a very young lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes
addressing the esaul while Denísov was reading the dispatch
All the way Pétya had been preparing himself to behave with Denísov as befitted a grown-up man and an officer—without hinting at their previous acquaintance
And turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting place arranged near the watchman’s hut in the forest
and told the officer on the Kirghíz horse (who performed the duties of an adjutant) to go and find out where Dólokhov was and whether he would come that evening
Denísov himself intended going with the esaul and Pétya to the edge of the forest where it reached out to Shámshevo
accompanied by some Cossacks and the hussar who had the prisoner
and advanced to where the screen of trees was less dense
On reaching a large oak tree that had not yet shed its leaves
crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist
a man wearing something red was running through the marsh
that he had neither seen nor heard anything of them
the elder replied that some  more-orderers  had really been at their village
soon showed a great liking and aptitude for partisan warfare
At night he would go out for booty and always brought back French clothing and weapons
and when told to would bring in French captives also
with equal ease picking fleas out of its fur or crunching thick bones
Tíkhon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at arm’s length
or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegs or carve spoons
In Denísov’s party he held a peculiar and exceptional position
Once a Frenchman Tíkhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him and shot him in the fleshy part of the back
pretended to be angry and swore at the French with the funniest curses
The only effect of this incident on Tíkhon was that after being wounded he seldom brought in prisoners
and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the Cossacks and hussars and willingly accepted that role
Now he had been sent by Denísov overnight to Shámshevo to capture a  tongue
But whether because he had not been content to take only one Frenchman or because he had slept through the night
He had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax stuck in his girdle
His wrinkled and pockmarked face and narrow little eyes beamed with self-satisfied merriment
and I crept like this through the wood and lay down
Tíkhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other
looking cheerfully and resolutely into Denísov’s eyes
and rode all the way to the watchhouse in silence and frowning angrily
Tíkhon followed behind and Pétya heard the Cossacks laughing with him and at him
about some pair of boots he had thrown into the bushes
and to question the esaul with an air of importance about tomorrow’s undertaking
that he might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself
having left his people after their departure from Moscow
and especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in the battle of Vyázma
Pétya had been in a constant state of blissful excitement at being grown-up and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to miss any chance to do something really heroic
He was highly delighted with what he saw and experienced in the army
but at the same time it always seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were being performed just where he did not happen to be
And he was always in a hurry to get where he was not
When on the twenty-first of October his general expressed a wish to send somebody to Denísov’s detachment
Pétya begged so piteously to be sent that the general could not refuse
But when dispatching him he recalled Pétya’s mad action at the battle of Vyázma
where instead of riding by the road to the place to which he had been sent
he had galloped to the advanced line under the fire of the French and had there twice fired his pistol
So now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any action whatever of Denísov’s
That was why Pétya had blushed and grown confused when Denísov asked him whether he could stay
Before they had ridden to the outskirts of the forest Pétya had considered he must carry out his instructions strictly and return at once
and Cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade and were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the French could not see the smoke
In the passage of the small watchhouse a Cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton
and at once began helping the officers to fix up the dinner table
Pétya was in an ecstatic childish state of love for all men
He tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was foolish
blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared ironical
had already been changed by the Cossacks into Vesénny (vernal) and into Vesénya by the peasants and soldiers
said the drummer boy in a trembling almost childish voice
considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him
But he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy
CHAPTER VIII  The arrival of Dólokhov diverted Pétya’s attention from the drummer boy
to whom Denísov had had some mutton and vodka given
and whom he had had dressed in a Russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and not sent away with the other prisoners
Pétya had heard in the army many stories of Dólokhov’s extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to the French
so from the moment he entered the hut Pétya did not take his eyes from him
had an icon of Nicholas the Wonder-Worker on his breast
had now the appearance of a most correct officer of the Guards
He was clean-shaven and wore a Guardsman’s padded coat with an Order of St
George at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set straight on his head
He took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of the room
and without greeting anyone went up to Denísov and began questioning him about the matter in hand
And I say boldly that I have not a single man’s life on my conscience
Would it be difficult for you to send thirty or thwee hundwed men to town under escort
instead of staining—I speak bluntly—staining the honor of a soldier
Who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over
While Dólokhov had been disputing with Denísov what should be done with prisoners
But above all Denísov must not dare to imagine that I’ll obey him and that he can order me about
CHAPTER IX  Having put on French greatcoats and shakos
Pétya and Dólokhov rode to the clearing from which Denísov had reconnoitered the French camp
Noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road
on both sides of which French talk could be heard around the campfires
Dólokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their regiment
said a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh
Dólokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther that night
He handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long neck
Dólokhov remarked that the Cossacks were a danger only to stragglers such as his companion and himself
Pétya thought every moment as he stood by the campfire listening to the talk
Asking about the Russian prisoners with that detachment
so strange that Pétya thought the French would immediately detect their disguise
and a French officer whom they could not see (he lay wrapped in a greatcoat) rose and whispered something to a companion
Pétya recognized the sound of Russian voices and saw the dark figures of Russian prisoners round their campfires
When they had descended to the bridge Pétya and Dólokhov rode past the sentinel
who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it
Near the watchman’s hut the black shapes of the Cossacks’ shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen
Not all the Cossacks and hussars were asleep; here and there
amid the sounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by
And Pétya gave the Cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but also of his object
The Cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at Pétya
sitting on a wagon captured from the French beside which horses were tethered
that under it Likhachëv was sitting sharpening a saber for him
that the big dark blotch to the right was the watchman’s hut
and the red blotch below to the left was the dying embers of a campfire
that the man who had come for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink; but he neither knew nor waited to know anything of all this
He was in a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled reality
It might really have been that the hussar came for water and went back into the hollow
but perhaps he had simply vanished—disappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness
Nothing Pétya could have seen now would have surprised him
The melody grew and passed from one instrument to another
And what was played was a fugue—though Pétya had not the least conception of what a fugue is
Each instrument—now resembling a violin and now a horn
but better and clearer than violin or horn—played its own part
and before it had finished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost the same air
Pétya did not know how long this lasted: he enjoyed himself all the time
The horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to their very tails
Denísov stood by the watchman’s hut giving final orders
but Pétya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and
He did not say another word to Pétya but rode in silence all the way
When they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably growing light over the field
Cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him
and the first thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a Frenchman
flashed through Pétya’s mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing could be heard
The shots came from the yard of the landowner’s house he had visited the night before with Dólokhov
The Cossacks and Dólokhov galloped after Pétya into the gateway of the courtyard
but instead of holding the reins he waved both his arms about rapidly and strangely
Among the Russian prisoners rescued by Denísov and Dólokhov was Pierre Bezúkhov
CHAPTER XII  During the whole of their march from Moscow no fresh orders had been issued by the French authorities concerning the party of prisoners among whom was Pierre
On the twenty-second of October that party was no longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had left Moscow
Not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in front of the prisoners was left; they had all disappeared
The symptoms of disorder that Pierre had noticed at their first halting place after leaving Moscow had now reached the utmost limit
but had afterwards reassembled and abused each other for their causeless panic
Of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and twenty wagons
not more than sixty now remained; the rest had been captured or left behind
Some of Junot’s wagons also had been captured or abandoned
Three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers from Davout’s corps
Of the three hundred and thirty men who had set out from Moscow fewer than a hundred now remained
The prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even the cavalry saddles or Junot’s baggage
They understood that the saddles and Junot’s spoon might be of some use
of giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering their own plight still worse
and after the third stage Pierre had rejoined Karatáev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog that had chosen Karatáev for its master
On the third day after leaving Moscow Karatáev again fell ill with the fever he had suffered from in the hospital in Moscow
but since Karatáev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to go near him
When he did so and heard the subdued moaning with which Karatáev generally lay down at the halting places
and when he smelled the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before
Pierre moved farther away and did not think about him
and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from superfluity
And now during these last three weeks of the march he had learned still another new
consolatory truth—that nothing in this world is terrible
He had learned that as there is no condition in which man can be happy and entirely free
so there is no condition in which he need be unhappy and lack freedom
He learned that suffering and freedom have their limits and that those limits are very near together; that the person in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as he now
sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled while the other was warming; and that when he had put on tight dancing shoes he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet that were covered with sores—his footgear having long since fallen to pieces
He discovered that when he had married his wife—of his own free will as it had seemed to him—he had been no more free than now when they locked him up at night in a stable
and at night there were the campfires; the lice that devoured him warmed his body
Only now did Pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing to another
which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limit
The harder his position became and the more terrible the future
looking at his feet and at the roughness of the way
Occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and then again at his feet
The former and the latter were alike familiar and his own
The blue-gray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side of the road
sometimes in proof of its agility and self-satisfaction lifting one hind leg and hopping along on three
and then again going on all four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion
The dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in Moscow
All around lay the flesh of different animals—from men to horses—in various stages of decomposition; and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the dog could eat all it wanted
It had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it might cease and the sky clear
but far down and deep within him his soul was occupied with something important and comforting
There Platón Karatáev was sitting covered up—head and all—with his greatcoat as if it were a vestment
the hour when Karatáev was usually free of his fever and particularly lively
When Pierre reached the fire and heard Platón’s voice enfeebled by illness
Pierre now listened to that tale as to something new
and the quiet rapture Karatáev evidently felt as he told it communicated itself also to Pierre
The story was of an old merchant who lived a good and God-fearing life with his family
and next morning his companion was found robbed and with his throat cut
while another had simply been a vagrant and had done nothing
After a while the Tsar’s decree came: to set the merchant free and give him a compensation that had been awarded
The paper arrived and they began to look for the old man
The expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at the approach of those in authority
before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled by
and in the expression with which he frowned and looked away Pierre thought he detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy
and Pierre saw Karatáev whom he had not yet seen that morning
Karatáev looked at Pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with tears
He made as if he did not notice that look and moved hastily away
When the prisoners again went forward Pierre looked round
Karatáev was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and two Frenchmen were talking over his head
He again slept as he had done at Mozháysk after the battle of Borodinó
Everything changes and moves and that movement is God
And suddenly he saw vividly before him a long-forgotten
This globe was alive—a vibrating ball without fixed dimensions
A Frenchman who had just pushed a Russian soldier away was squatting by the fire
red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod
was sitting near the fire patting something with his hand
the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spent with a beautiful Polish lady on the veranda of his house in Kiev
and he sank into water so that it closed over his head
and a moment later a crowd of Russians surrounded Pierre
walked behind some Cossacks who were carrying the body of Pétya Rostóv to a hole that had been dug in the garden
CHAPTER XVI  After the twenty-eighth of October when the frosts began
while carriages with people dressed in furs continued to drive past
and dukes; but the process of the flight and disintegration of the French army went on essentially as before
From Moscow to Vyázma the French army of seventy-three thousand men not reckoning the Guards (who did nothing during the whole war but pillage) was reduced to thirty-six thousand
though not more than five thousand had fallen in battle
From this beginning the succeeding terms of the progression could be determined mathematically
Scarcely a quarter of the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments
the others go off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food and escape discipline
In general they regard Smolénsk as the place where they hope to recover
Many have died these last days on the road or at the bivouacs
and when everything had been plundered fled farther
they all felt that they were miserable wretches who had done much evil for which they had now to pay
And though they pretended to be concerned about the army
each was thinking only of himself and of how to get away quickly and save himself
CHAPTER XVII  The movements of the Russian and French armies during the campaign from Moscow back to the Niemen were like those in a game of Russian blindman’s buff
but when he gets into a tight place he runs away as quietly as he can
and often thinking to escape runs straight into his opponent’s arms
but later when they reached the Smolénsk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tight—and often thinking they were escaping ran right into the Russians
Owing to the rapidity of the French flight and the Russian pursuit and the consequent exhaustion of the horses
as a result of the frequent and rapid change of position by each army
even what information was obtained could not be delivered in time
If news was received one day that the enemy had been in a certain position the day before
by the third day when something could have been done
Beyond Smolénsk there were several different roads available for the French
and one would have thought that during their stay of four days they might have learned where the enemy was
expecting Napoleon to take the road to the right beyond the Dnieper—which was the only reasonable thing for him to do—themselves turned to the right and came out onto the highroad at Krásnoe
And here as in a game of blindman’s buff the French ran into our vanguard
had been busying himself blowing up the walls of Smolénsk which were in nobody’s way
because despite the unfortunate plight of the French or because of it
and having crossed the Dnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot
From Orshá they fled farther along the road to Vílna
CHAPTER XVIII  This campaign consisted in a flight of the French during which they did all they could to destroy themselves
So one might have thought that regarding this period of the campaign the historians
who attributed the actions of the mass to the will of one man
Mountains of books have been written by the historians about this campaign
as well as the military genius shown by his marshals
The retreat from Málo-Yaroslávets when he had a free road into a well-supplied district and the parallel road was open to him along which Kutúzov afterwards pursued him—this unnecessary retreat along a devastated road—is explained to us as being due to profound considerations
where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle and take personal command
abandoning to its fate the scattered fragments of the army he left behind
I have acted the Emperor long enough; it is time to act      the general
Then we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals
described in ordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child is taught to be ashamed of—even that act finds justification in the historians’ language
When it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of historical ratiocination any farther
when actions are clearly contrary to all that humanity calls right or even just
And it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit one’s own nothingness and immeasurable meanness
reading the account of the last part of the campaign of 1812
which when numerically weaker than the French had given battle at Borodinó
did not achieve its purpose when it had surrounded the French on three sides and when its aim was to capture them
The explanation of this strange fact given by Russian military historians (to the effect that Kutúzov hindered an attack) is unfounded
for we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at Vyázma and Tarútino
Why was the Russian army—which with inferior forces had withstood the enemy in full strength at Borodinó—defeated at Krásnoe and the Berëzina by the disorganized crowds of the French when it was numerically superior
If the aim of the Russians consisted in cutting off and capturing Napoleon and his marshals—and that aim was not merely frustrated but all attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled—then this last period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the French to be a series of victories
and quite wrongly considered victorious by Russian historians
The Russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims of logic must admit that conclusion
must reluctantly admit that the French retreat from Moscow was a series of victories for Napoleon and defeats for Kutúzov
But putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a conclusion involves a contradiction
since the series of French victories brought the French complete destruction
while the series of Russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the liberation of their country
have attributed to this last period of the war of 1812 an aim that never existed
it would have been senseless to sacrifice one’s own troops in order to destroy the French army
and dukes—whose capture would have been in the highest degree embarrassing for the Russians
as the most adroit diplomatists of the time (Joseph de Maistre and others) recognized
Still more senseless would have been the wish to capture army corps of the French
when our own army had melted away to half before reaching Krásnoe and a whole division would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners
and when our men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners already taken were perishing of hunger
All the profound plans about cutting off and capturing Napoleon and his army were like the plan of a market gardener who
The only thing to be said in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry
But not even that could be said for those who drew up this project
for it was not they who had suffered from the trampled beds
because to paralyze the momentum with which Napoleon’s army was retiring
To cut off an army—to bar its road—is quite impossible
for there is always plenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can be seen
as the military scientists might convince themselves by the example of Krásnoe and of the Berëzina
It is only possible to capture prisoners if they agree to be captured
just as it is only possible to catch a swallow if it settles on one’s hand
But the French troops quite rightly did not consider that this suited them
because never since the world began has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained in 1812
and the Russian army in its pursuit of the French strained its strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroying itself
During the movement of the Russian army from Tarútino to Krásnoe it lost fifty thousand sick or stragglers
and was camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees of frost
when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and the rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be maintained
where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and cold
and Chichagóv should have crossed (more than knee-deep in snow) to somewhere else
To them the words of Milorádovich seem very interesting
and so do their surmises and the rewards this or that general received; but the question of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves does not even interest them
for it does not come within the range of their investigation
Yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a direct part in the events
and all the questions that seemed insoluble easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution
The aim of cutting off Napoleon and his army never existed except in the imaginations of a dozen people
It could not exist because it was senseless and unattainable
and so it was only necessary not to stop their flight
Secondly it was attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the French
and thirdly by the fact that a large Russian army was following the French
ready to use its strength in case their movement stopped
The Russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal
And the experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a menace than to strike the running animal on the head
BOOK FIFTEEN: 1812 - 13      CHAPTER I  When seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror: substance similar to his own is perishing before his eyes
But when it is a beloved and intimate human being that is dying
which like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes heals
but always aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch
After Prince Andrew’s death Natásha and Princess Mary alike felt this
They carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact
interrupting that necessary quiet in which they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful choir that still resounded in their imagination
and hindered their gazing into those mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before them
To admit the possibility of a future seemed to them to insult his memory
Still more carefully did they avoid anything relating to him who was dead
It seemed to them that what they had lived through and experienced could not be expressed in words
and constant avoidance of everything that might lead up to the subject—this halting on all sides at the boundary of what they might not mention—brought before their minds with still greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling
in her position as absolute and independent arbiter of her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew
was the first to be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt for the first fortnight
She received letters from her relations to which she had to reply; the room in which little Nicholas had been put was damp and he began to cough; Alpátych came to Yaroslávl with reports on the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they should return to Moscow to the house on the Vozdvízhenka Street
which had remained uninjured and needed only slight repairs
Life did not stand still and it was necessary to live
Hard as it was for Princess Mary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she had lived till then
and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave Natásha alone
with difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation rather than of sorrow
After she felt herself deserted by Princes Mary and alone in her grief
Natásha spent most of the time in her room by herself
sitting huddled up feet and all in the corner of the sofa
tearing and twisting something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on
evidently waiting impatiently for the intruder to go
was crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa
nervously crumpling and smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of the door
of which she had never before thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and improbable
was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side of life
where everything was either emptiness and desolation or suffering and indignity
and sometimes devised other words they might have spoken
and began to speak seriously:   One thing would be terrible
She now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what she had then felt
that it would be dreadful if he always continued to suffer
And now he again seemed to be saying the same words to her
You know that for me there is nothing in life but you
and to suffer with you is the greatest happiness for me
and he took her hand and pressed it as he had pressed it that terrible evening four days before his death
that all their words and feelings seemed an insult to the world in which she had been living of late
and she felt not merely indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility
He had evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were choking him
she felt a dreadful ache as if something was being torn inside her and she were dying
the terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard through the door
The countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position
and seeing Natásha began to press her daughter’s head with all her strength
straining all the power of her love to find some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that crushed her mother
And again in a futile struggle with reality her mother
During the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes
and Natásha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes
but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak
Sónya and the count tried to replace Natásha but could not
They saw that she alone was able to restrain her mother from unreasoning despair
When the news of Pétya’s death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty
and for three weeks looked after Natásha as if she had been a sick child
The last weeks passed in her mother’s bedroom had strained Natásha’s physical strength
One afternoon noticing Natásha shivering with fever
making Princess Mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings
From that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only between women was established between Princess Mary and Natásha
They were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and spent most of their time together
When one went out the other became restless and hastened to rejoin her
Together they felt more in harmony with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone
A feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them; an exclusive feeling of life being possible only in each other’s presence
now feeling herself bound to Princess Mary by affection
learned to love her past too and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible to her
listening to Natásha’s tales of childhood and early youth
they never mentioned him so as not to lower (as they thought) their exalted feelings by words; but this silence about him had the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without being conscious of it
One day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath
Another time when she called Dunyásha her voice trembled
but beneath the layer of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable
delicate young shoots of grass were already sprouting
At the end of January Princess Mary left for Moscow
The flight was so rapid that the Russian army pursuing the French could not keep up with them; cavalry and artillery horses broke down
and the information received of the movements of the French was never reliable
The men in the Russian army were so worn out by this continuous marching at the rate of twenty-seven miles a day that they could not go any faster
To realize the degree of exhaustion of the Russian army it is only necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that
while not losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after Tarútino and less than a hundred prisoners
the Russian army which left that place a hundred thousand strong reached Krásnoe with only fifty thousand
The rapidity of the Russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army as the flight of the French was to theirs
The only difference was that the Russian army moved voluntarily
with no such threat of destruction as hung over the French
and that the sick Frenchmen were left behind in enemy hands while the sick Russians left behind were among their own people
The chief cause of the wastage of Napoleon’s army was the rapidity of its movement
since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident
another reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to Kutúzov
and so the closer our troops trod on their heels the greater distance they had to cover
Only by following at some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the French
All the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of the army and a lengthening of its marches
whereas the only reasonable aim was to shorten those marches
To that end Kutúzov’s activity was directed during the whole campaign from Moscow to Vílna—not casually or intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it
Kutúzov felt and knew—not by reasoning or science but with the whole of his Russian being—what every Russian soldier felt: that the French were beaten
that the enemy was flying and must be driven out; but at the same time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march
and for some reason to capture a king or a duke—it seemed that now—when any battle must be horrible and senseless—was the very time to fight and conquer somebody
and half starved—who within a month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number
where they expected to find one of the three French columns and stumbled instead on Napoleon himself with sixteen thousand men
Despite all Kutúzov’s efforts to avoid that ruinous encounter and to preserve his troops
the massacre of the broken mob of French soldiers by worn-out Russians continued at Krásnoe for three days
And as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition
who said he did not want to know anything about the commissariat affairs of his detachment
with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could scarcely move
were but blind tools of the most melancholy law of necessity
but considered themselves heroes and imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable deed
They blamed Kutúzov and said that from the very beginning of the campaign he had prevented their vanquishing Napoleon
that he thought of nothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from the Linen Factories because he was comfortable there
that at Krásnoe he checked the advance because on learning that Napoleon was there he had quite lost his head
but posterity and history have acclaimed Napoleon as grand
and by Russians as something indefinite—a sort of puppet useful only because he had a Russian name
Such is the fate not of great men (grands hommes) whom the Russian mind does not acknowledge
showed human dignity—Napoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm; he is grand
But Kutúzov—the man who from the beginning to the end of his activity in 1812
never once swerving by word or deed from Borodinó to Vílna
presented an example exceptional in history of self-sacrifice and a present consciousness of the future importance of what was happening—Kutúzov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful
and when speaking of him and of the year 1812 they always seem a little ashamed
And yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose activity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim; and it would be difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the will of the whole people
Still more difficult would it be to find an instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being so completely accomplished as that to which all Kutúzov’s efforts were directed in 1812
and never contradicted those who tried to prove anything to him
When Count Rostopchín at the Yaúza bridge galloped up to Kutúzov with personal reproaches for having caused the destruction of Moscow
and said:  How was it you promised not to abandon Moscow without a battle
though a moment before he had said quite the contrary
What did it matter to him—who then alone amid a senseless crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what was happening—what did it matter to him whether Rostopchín attributed the calamities of Moscow to him or to himself
Still less could it matter to him who was appointed chief of the artillery
from which time his disagreement with those about him began
he alone said that the battle of Borodinó was a victory
and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches and reports up to the time of his death
He alone during the retreat of the French said that all our maneuvers are useless
nor the Krásnoe battles were necessary; that we must keep some force to reach the frontier with
he alone—incurring thereby the Emperor’s displeasure—said in Vílna that to carry the war beyond the frontier is useless and harmful
Nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the events
investing the preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity
declared till his death that Borodinó was a victory
despite the assurance of generals that the battle was lost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after winning a battle was unprecedented
and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of Russia crossed
so truly discern the importance of the people’s view of the events that in all his activity he was never once untrue to it
The source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in full purity and strength
to select him—an old man in disfavor—to be their representative in the national war
CHAPTER VI  The fifth of November was the first day of what is called the battle of Krásnoe
Toward evening—after much disputing and many mistakes made by generals who did not go to their proper places
and after adjutants had been sent about with counterorders—when it had become plain that the enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no battle
Kutúzov rode to Dóbroe on his plump little white horse
followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who whispered among themselves behind his back
buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged in anything they had been able to get hold of
were standing in the road beside a long row of unharnessed French guns
At the approach of the commander in chief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on Kutúzov who
One of the generals was reporting to him where the guns and prisoners had been captured
Kutúzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was saying
the soldier with the sores immediately turned away and went on with what he was doing
addressing the soldiers and then again the officers
While the soldiers were shouting Kutúzov leaned forward in his saddle and bowed his head
and all at once his voice and the expression of his face changed
It was no longer the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted to tell his comrades something very important
There was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of the soldiers
wondering gaze fixed upon him he read sympathy with what he had said
His face grew brighter and brighter with an old man’s mild smile
which drew the corners of his lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles
And flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first time during the whole campaign
and left the broken ranks of the soldiers laughing joyfully and shouting  Hurrah
Kutúzov’s words were hardly understood by the troops
No one could have repeated the field marshal’s address
begun solemnly and then changing into an old man’s simplehearted talk; but the hearty sincerity of that speech
the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foe and consciousness of the justice of our cause
exactly expressed by that old man’s good-natured expletives
was not merely understood but lay in the soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and long-sustained shouts
All day it had been calm and frosty with occasional lightly falling snow and toward evening it began to clear
Through the falling snow a purple-black and starry sky showed itself and the frost grew keener
An infantry regiment which had left Tarútino three thousand strong but now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that night at its halting place—a village on the highroad
the regiment began to prepare its lair and its food
A third section scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff officers
but despite their united efforts the wattle hardly moved
suddenly came the authoritative voice of a sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden
The soldier who had been struck groaned and wiped his face
When they were out of the village they began talking again as loud as before
and some stripping themselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirts
the army had never under the best material conditions presented a more cheerful and animated aspect
This was because all who began to grow depressed or who lost strength were sifted out of the army day by day
All the physically or morally weak had long since been left behind and only the flower of the army—physically and mentally—remained
More men collected behind the wattle fence of the Eighth Company than anywhere else
Two sergeants major were sitting with them and their campfire blazed brighter than others
This red-haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal
rose obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into the light of the fire the slender
with sudden resolution turning to the sergeant major
continued the man who had wondered at their whiteness
And several of the men went over to the Fifth Company
CHAPTER IX  The fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest
A huge campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow
lighting up the branches of trees heavy with hoarfrost
and out of the forest into the bright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging to one another
hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers did not understand
One was taller than the other; he wore an officer’s hat and seemed quite exhausted
and brought some buckwheat porridge and vodka for both of them
Ramballe refused food and resting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire
looking at the Russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes
tried to impress on the soldiers the fact that Ramballe was an officer and ought to be warmed
A Russian officer who had come up to the fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would not take a French officer into his hut to warm him
and he leaned his head against the shoulder of one of the men like a child
a short sturdy Frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes
Give him some porridge: it takes a long time to get filled up after starving
They gave him some more porridge and Morel with a laugh set to work on his third bowl
they were busy whispering something gladsome and mysterious to one another
CHAPTER X  The French army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical progression; and that crossing of the Berëzina about which so much has been written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction
and not at all the decisive episode of the campaign
If so much has been and still is written about the Berëzina
on the French side this is only because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their army had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory
and on the Russian side merely because in Petersburg—far from the seat of war—a plan (again one of Pfuel’s) had been devised to catch Napoleon in a strategic trap at the Berëzina River
Everyone assured himself that all would happen according to plan
and therefore insisted that it was just the crossing of the Berëzina that destroyed the French army
The French crowd fled at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to reaching its goal
It fled like a wounded animal and it was impossible to block its path
people from Moscow and women with children who were with the French transport
The condition of fugitives and of pursuers was equally bad
would be on a lower level to claim a share in the necessities of life
those favorable to the French—and even the Frenchmen in the Russian service—could do nothing for the prisoners
The French perished from the conditions to which the Russian army was itself exposed
and on that the whole strength of the French was concentrated
on which (in consequence of the Petersburg plan) special hopes had been placed by the Russians
The ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a respectful form
making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was to blame
They did not talk seriously to him; when reporting to him or asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable formality
but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at every turn
Because they could not understand him all these people assumed that it was useless to talk to the old man; that he would never grasp the profundity of their plans
that he would answer with his phrases (which they thought were mere phrases) about a  golden bridge
while what they proposed was so complicated and clever
After the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and Petersburg hero Wittgenstein
this mood and the gossip of the staff reached their maximum
did he get angry and write to Bennigsen (who reported separately to the Emperor) the following letter:   On account of your spells of ill health
will your excellency please be so good as to set off for Kalúga on receipt of this
the Grand Duke Tsarévich Constantine Pávlovich joined the army
he informed Kutúzov of the Emperor’s displeasure at the poor success of our forces and the slowness of their advance
and that the power he was supposed to hold was no longer his
And he understood this not merely from the attitude of the court
He saw on the one hand that the military business in which he had played his part was ended and felt that his mission was accomplished; and at the same time he began to be conscious of the physical weariness of his aged body and of the necessity of physical rest
On the twenty-ninth of November Kutúzov entered Vílna—his  dear Vílna  as he called it
besides the comforts of life of which he had so long been deprived
And he suddenly turned from the cares of army and state and
as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed
immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been accustomed
one of the most zealous  cutters-off  and  breakers-up
who had first wanted to effect a diversion in Greece and then in Warsaw but never wished to go where he was sent: Chichagóv
noted for the boldness with which he spoke to the Emperor
he handed Kutúzov a garrison report and the keys of the town
The contemptuously respectful attitude of the younger men to the old man in his dotage was expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of Chichagóv
Kutúzov incidentally mentioned that the vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at Borísov had been recovered and would be restored to him
replied with his subtle penetrating smile:  I meant merely to say what I said
Contrary to the Emperor’s wish Kutúzov detained the greater part of the army at Vílna
and while awaiting the Emperor’s arrival led a dissipated life
and others—the Emperor reached Vílna on the eleventh
and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to the castle
In spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff officers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle
A minute later the old man’s large stout figure in full-dress uniform
holding his gloves in his hand and walking with an effort sideways down the steps to the level of the street
took in his hand the report he had prepared for the Emperor
There was running to and fro and whispering; another troyka flew furiously up
and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh in which the figures of the Emperor and Volkónski could already be descried
The Emperor greeted the officers and the Semënov guard
and again pressing the old man’s hand went with him into the castle
When alone with the field marshal the Emperor expressed his dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made at Krásnoe and the Berëzina
expressionless look with which he had listened to the Emperor’s commands on the field of Austerlitz seven years before settled on his face now
When Kutúzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait
he was arrested by someone’s voice saying:   Your Serene Highness
Kutúzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of Count Tolstóy
who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay a small object
Kutúzov seemed not to understand what was expected of him
Suddenly he seemed to remember; a scarcely perceptible smile flashed across his puffy face
George of the First Class and the Emperor showed him the highest honors
but everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him
The proprieties were observed and the Emperor was the first to set that example
ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the Emperor’s feet on his entering the ballroom
The Emperor’s displeasure with Kutúzov was specially increased at Vílna by the fact that Kutúzov evidently could not or would not understand the importance of the coming campaign
Kutúzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of Russia
but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that Russia had gained
He tried to prove to the Emperor the impossibility of levying fresh troops
the natural method was to do what had been done with him at Austerlitz and with Barclay at the beginning of the Russian campaign—to transfer the authority to the Emperor himself
thus cutting the ground from under the commander in chief’s feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of the change
Everyone spoke loudly of the field marshal’s great weakness and failing health
and gradually—just as he had come from Turkey to the Treasury in Petersburg to recruit the militia
and then to the army when he was needed there—now when his part was played out
The movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a movement of peoples from east to west
and for this fresh war another leader was necessary
having qualities and views differing from Kutúzov’s and animated by different motives
Scarcely any impression was left on Pierre’s mind by all that happened to him from the time of his rescue till his illness
He remembered a general impression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of being worried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him
he also remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses
and above all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all that time
after surviving the battle of Borodinó for more than a month had recently died in the Rostóvs’ house at Yaroslávl
All this at the time seemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt he could not grasp its significance
Just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly as possible from places where people were killing one another
and think over all the strange new facts he had learned; but on reaching Orël he immediately fell ill
who had come from Moscow; and also his cousin the eldest princess
who had been living on his estate at Eléts and hearing of his rescue and illness had come to look after him
But for a long time in his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity
No one demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere
said he to himself when a cleanly laid table was moved up to him with savory beef tea
or when he lay down for the night on a soft clean bed
the thing he had continually sought to find—the aim of life—no longer existed for him now
That search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared temporarily—he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not present itself again
And this very absence of an aim gave him the complete
That search for an aim had been simply a search for God
and suddenly in his captivity he had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his nurse had told him long ago: that God is here and everywhere
In his captivity he had learned that in Karatáev God was greater
more infinite and unfathomable than in the Architect of the Universe recognized by the Freemasons
He felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into the far distance finds what he sought at his very feet
All his life he had looked over the heads of the men around him
when he should have merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes
In the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable infinite something
He had only felt that it must exist somewhere and had looked for it
He had equipped himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space
a simple answer was now always ready in his soul:  Because there is a God
that God without whose will not one hair falls from a man’s head
As before he was absent-minded and seemed occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special of his own
The difference between his former and present self was that formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to him
he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking to distinguish something at a distance
At present he still forgot what was said to him and still did not see what was before his eyes
but he now looked with a scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what was before him and listened to what was said
though evidently seeing and hearing something quite different
Now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips
who had never liked Pierre and had been particularly hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him after the old count’s death
Formerly she had felt that he regarded her with indifference and irony
The most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more successfully
evoking memories of the best times of her youth and showing sympathy with them
when he had helped him undress and wished him good night
and then would go out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and affection for him
The doctor who attended Pierre and visited him every day
though he considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every moment was of value to suffering humanity
and the princess used to make fun of the tenderness the Italian expressed for him
Pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the Italian merely by evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing
Willarski was married to a Russian heiress who had a large estate in Orël province
came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacy that people who meet in a desert generally express for one another
To Pierre as he looked at and listened to Willarski
He regarded all these occupations as hindrances to life
was interested in this strange though very familiar phenomenon
This was his acknowledgment of the impossibility of changing a man’s convictions by words
pleased him and drew from him an amused and gentle smile
In the old days he had been unable to find a way out of all these surmises and had given to all who asked as long as he had anything to give
Formerly he had been in a similar state of perplexity with regard to every question concerning his property
when one person advised one thing and another something else
Now to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt or perplexity about these questions
There was now within him a judge who by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be done
He was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters
but now he felt certain of what ought and what ought not to be done
concluded by making what amounted to a demand that Pierre should give him four thousand francs to send to his wife and children
Pierre refused without the least difficulty or effort
and was afterwards surprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear so insurmountably difficult
At the same time that he refused the colonel’s demand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to artifice when leaving Orël
to induce the Italian officer to accept some money of which he was evidently in need
A further proof to Pierre of his own more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decision with regard to his wife’s debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in and near Moscow
To console Pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an estimate showing that despite these losses his income would not be diminished but would even be increased if he refused to pay his wife’s debts which he was under no obligation to meet
and did not rebuild his Moscow house and the country house on his Moscow estate
But in January Savélich came from Moscow and gave him an account of the state of things there
About the same time he received letters from Prince Vasíli and other Petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wife’s debts
Willarski was going to Moscow and they agreed to travel together
the peasants on the roads and in the villages—had a new significance for him
The presence and remarks of Willarski who continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of Russia and its backwardness compared with Europe only heightened Pierre’s pleasure
He did not contradict Willarski and even seemed to agree with him—an apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions that could lead to nothing—and he smiled joyfully as he listened to him
except something intangible yet powerful and indestructible
Trains of peasant carts came to Moscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in the ruined houses and the streets
The Cossacks carried off what they could to their camps
But the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third contingent
and with increasing numbers plundering became more and more difficult and assumed more definite forms
The French found Moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of regular life
and peasants—streamed into Moscow as blood flows to the heart
and beat down one another’s prices to below what they had been in former days
Cookshops and taverns were opened in partially burned houses
The clergy resumed the services in many churches that had not been burned
Donors contributed Church property that had been stolen
Government clerks set up their baize-covered tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms
The higher authorities and the police organized the distribution of goods left behind by the French
complained of the injustice of taking everything to the Faceted Palace in the Krémlin; others insisted that as the French had gathered things from different houses into this or that house
CHAPTER XV  At the end of January Pierre went to Moscow and stayed in an annex of his house which had not been burned
He called on Count Rostopchín and on some acquaintances who were back in Moscow
Pierre felt particularly well disposed toward them all
but was now instinctively on his guard for fear of binding himself in any way
He had heard that the Rostóvs were at Kostromá but the thought of Natásha seldom occurred to him
If it did it was only as a pleasant memory of the distant past
and last days of Prince Andrew had often occupied Pierre’s thoughts and now recurred to him with fresh vividness
Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in
and yet so similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he felt for both of them
Pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood
who met Pierre with a stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence of the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the house
A few minutes later the footman returned with Dessalles
who brought word from the princess that she would be very glad to see Pierre if he would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment
In a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her another person dressed in black
Pierre remembered that the princess always had lady companions
It was the first piece of good news we had received for a long time
Princess Mary’s face expressed still greater embarrassment
like the opening of a door grown rusty on its hinges
a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes
But as soon as he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with Princess Mary he again glanced at Natásha
and a still-deeper flush suffused his face and a still-stronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul
He became confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was saying
Pierre had failed to notice Natásha because he did not at all expect to see her there
but that was not what made her unrecognizable; she was unrecognizable at the moment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with a suppressed smile of the joy of life
now when he first entered and glanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile: only her eyes were kindly attentive and sadly interrogative
Pierre’s confusion was not reflected by any confusion on Natásha’s part
Natásha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped
but at the same time he felt that his freedom had also completely gone
He felt that there was now a judge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to him than that of all the rest of the world
but whatever he was saying he regarded from her standpoint
With all his soul he had always sought one thing—to be perfectly good—so he could not be afraid of death
Then suddenly Sónya told me he was traveling with us
And not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she had never yet mentioned to anyone—all she had lived through during those three weeks of their journey and life at Yaroslávl
and heard for the first time the story of those last days of her brother’s and Natásha’s love
and rushed from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow
Pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world
Princess Mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attention to her nephew who had entered the room
though a severe and grave expression had again settled on her face
They all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness which usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk
replied Pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him
They even tell me wonders I myself never dreamed of
Stepán Stepánych also instructed me how I ought to tell of my experiences
Though the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wife’s debts and to rebuild his houses
evidently not considering awkward the meaning Princess Mary had given to his words
When two people quarrel they are always both in fault
Pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look at Natásha
Everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner means being Napoleon’s guest
and Pierre who at first declined to speak about his captivity was gradually led on to do so
and from that was gradually led by Princess Mary’s questions and especially by Natásha’s into giving a detailed account of his adventures
At first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with him toward everybody and especially toward himself
but when he came to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed emotion of a man re-experiencing in recollection strong impressions he has lived through
Princess Mary with a gentle smile looked now at Pierre and now at Natásha
the expression of her face constantly changing with the narrative
but her exclamations and the brief questions she put
showed Pierre that she understood just what he wished to convey
When he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass over the horrible details
Now that he was telling it all to Natásha he experienced that pleasure which a man has when women listen to him—not clever women who when listening either try to remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunity offers to retell it
or who wish to adopt it to some thought of their own and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in their little mental workshop—but the pleasure given by real women gifted with a capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himself
She caught the unfinished word in its flight and took it straight into her open heart
divining the secret meaning of all Pierre’s mental travail
Princess Mary understood his story and sympathized with him
but she now saw something else that absorbed all her attention
She saw the possibility of love and happiness between Natásha and Pierre
as if trying to understand something more which he had perhaps left untold
Pierre in shamefaced and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her
’ then for heaven’s sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh
We imagine that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost
And the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as if it had been forgotten there
But probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending
At the entrance to Princess Mary’s house Pierre felt doubtful whether he had really been there the night before and really seen Natásha and talked to her
Perhaps I imagined it; perhaps I shall go in and find no one there
But he had hardly entered the room before he felt her presence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom
Had she been like this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment have failed to recognize her
and on her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression
Pierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there
Though Princess Mary and Natásha were evidently glad to see their visitor and though all Pierre’s interest was now centered in that house
by the evening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from one trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off
Princess Mary on the other hand instead of going away sank into an armchair
The weariness she had plainly shown before had now quite passed off
With a deep and long-drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk
She was going to say that to speak of love was impossible
all this treasure of feminine charm so strange to me now
and the expression on her face which accompanied them
CHAPTER XIX  There was nothing in Pierre’s soul now at all like what had troubled it during his courtship of Hélène
There was now not a shadow of doubt in his mind as to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrong
I believe all this—and suddenly Princess Mary will tell her
The whole meaning of life—not for him alone but for the whole world—seemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of being loved by her
At times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with one thing only—his future happiness
Sometimes it seemed to him that other people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests
In every word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness
He often surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them
And when he realized that people might not be aware of his happiness
he pitied them with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them that all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of attention
When it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service
or when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the assumption that everybody’s welfare depended on this or that issue of events
what he was feeling) and those unfortunates who evidently did not understand it—in the bright light of the emotion that shone within himself
and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met everything that was good and worthy of being loved
When dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife
Often in afterlife Pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity
On the contrary I was then wiser and had more insight than at any other time
to discover personal attributes which he termed  good qualities  in people before loving them; his heart was now overflowing with love
and by loving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes for loving them
CHAPTER XX  After Pierre’s departure that first evening
To her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to the surface and demanded satisfaction
but when Princess Mary mentioned him a long-extinguished light once more kindled in her eyes and her lips curved with a strange smile
The change that took place in Natásha at first surprised Princess Mary; but when she understood its meaning it grieved her
But when she was with Natásha she was not vexed with her and did not reproach her
The reawakened power of life that had seized Natásha was so evidently irrepressible and unexpected by her that in her presence Princess Mary felt that she had no right to reproach her even in her heart
And with a sad and rather stern look she told Natásha all that Pierre had said
FIRST EPILOGUE: 1813 - 20      CHAPTER I  Seven years had passed
The storm-tossed sea of European history had subsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm
But the mysterious forces that move humanity (mysterious because the laws of their motion are unknown to us) continued to operate
Though the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless
the coming formation and dissolution of kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of preparation
The historians call this activity of the historical figures  the reaction
pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted or condemned according to whether they conduced to progress or to reaction
He also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and disbanding the Semënov regiment
It would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the historians address to him
It lies in the fact that an historic character like Alexander I
and truth—that this character—though not lacking in virtue (the historians do not accuse him of that)—had not the same conception of the welfare of humanity fifty years ago as a present-day professor who from his youth upwards has been occupied with learning: that is
with books and lectures and with taking notes from them
But even if we assume that fifty years ago Alexander I was mistaken in his view of what was good for the people
we must inevitably assume that the historian who judges Alexander will also after the lapse of some time turn out to be mistaken in his view of what is good for humanity
The activity of Alexander or of Napoleon cannot be called useful or harmful
this is only because it does not agree with his limited understanding of what is good
or the prosperity of the Petersburg and other universities
or a certain kind of European culture called  progress  appear to me to be good or bad
I must admit that besides these things the action of every historic character has other more general purposes inaccessible to me
But let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by which to try historic characters and events; let us say that Alexander could have done everything differently; let us say that with guidance from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of the movement of humanity
What would then have become of the activity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in the government—an activity that in the opinion of the historians was good and beneficent
or anything else—then it is impossible to explain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions of chance and genius
If the aim of the European wars at the beginning of the nineteenth century had been the aggrandizement of Russia
it is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilization more expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives
The words chance and genius do not denote any really existing thing and therefore cannot be defined
Those words only denote a certain stage of understanding of phenomena
I do not know why a certain event occurs; I think that I cannot know it; so I do not try to know it and I talk about chance
the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a special enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others must seem to be a genius
And it must appear an astonishing conjunction of genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram
But the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to them happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims; they need only admit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken
and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened to the ram that was fattened
Even if they do not know for what purpose they are fattened
they will at least know that all that happened to the ram did not happen accidentally
and will no longer need the conceptions of chance or genius
Only by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately intelligible to us
and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond our ken
may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of historic characters and perceive the cause of the effect they produce (incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities)
and then the words chance and genius become superfluous
and in Russia—and that the movements from the west to the east and from the east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events
and not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius in Napoleon and Alexander
but we shall be unable to consider them to be anything but like other men
and we shall not be obliged to have recourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which made these people what they were
but it will be clear that all those small events were inevitable
By discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose
we shall clearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for any single plant better suited to it than those it produces
so it is impossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to the smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill
than Napoleon and Alexander with all their antecedents
CHAPTER III  The fundamental and essential significance of the European events of the beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass of the European peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west
The commencement of that movement was the movement from west to east
For the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement to Moscow it was necessary: (1) that they should form themselves into a military group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlike military group of the east
(2) that they should abandon all established traditions and customs
and murders which would have to be committed during that movement
and step by step a group was formed of larger dimensions with new customs and traditions
emerges—by what seem the strangest chances—from among all the seething French parties
and the dazzling and self-confident limitations of this man raise him to the head of the army
and his own childish audacity and self-confidence secure him military fame
Innumerable so-called chances accompany him everywhere
The disfavor into which he falls with the rulers of France turns to his advantage
His attempts to avoid his predestined path are unsuccessful: he is not received into the Russian service
and the appointment he seeks in Turkey comes to nothing
During the war in Italy he is several times on the verge of destruction and each time is saved in an unexpected manner
Owing to various diplomatic considerations the Russian armies—just those which might have destroyed his prestige—do not appear upon the scene till he is no longer there
On his return from Italy he finds the government in Paris in a process of dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped out and destroyed
this is glory—it resembles Caesar and Alexander the Great and is therefore good
This ideal of glory and grandeur—which consists not merely in considering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on every crime one commits
but the parties snatched at him and demanded his participation
and all men as if by agreement co-operate to confirm that power
Chance forms the characters of the rulers of France
who submit to him; chance forms the character of Paul I of Russia who recognizes his government; chance contrives a plot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his power
Chance and genius give him the victory at Austerlitz; and by chance all men
As if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement
In 1811 the group of people that had formed in France unites into one group with the peoples of Central Europe
The strength of the justification of the man who stands at the head of the movement grows with the increased size of the group
During the ten-year preparatory period this man had formed relations with all the crowned heads of Europe
The discredited rulers of the world can oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate Napoleonic ideal of glory and grandeur
One after another they hasten to display their insignificance before him
utilizes religion for the aggrandizement of the great man
It is not Napoleon who prepares himself for the accomplishment of his role
which in the mouths of those around him is not at once represented as a great deed
The invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal—Moscow
That city is taken; the Russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposing armies had suffered in the former war from Austerlitz to Wagram
But suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the predestined goal
and all the chances are now not for Napoleon but always against him
A countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east
and 1809—precede the great westward movement; there is the same coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions; the same adhesion of the people of Central Europe to the movement; the same hesitation midway
The man who ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand is sent to an island two days’ sail from France
which for some reason is presented to him as his dominion
and guards are given to him and millions of money are paid him
and on the calm surface eddies are formed in which float the diplomatists
who imagine that they have caused the floods to abate
But the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed
The diplomatists think that their disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure of natural forces; they anticipate war between their sovereigns; the position seems to them insoluble
The last backwash of the movement from the west occurs: a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperable diplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of history
but by strange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they cursed the day before and will curse again a month later
The actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his powder and paint: he will not be wanted any more
And some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself in solitude on his island
justifying his actions by intrigues and lies when the justification is no longer needed
and displaying to the whole world what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as an unseen hand directed his actions
Still greater coherence and inevitability is seen in the life of Alexander I
stood at the head of that movement from east to west
What was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with European affairs
but a remote sympathy not dulled by petty interests; a moral superiority over those sovereigns of the day who co-operated with him; a mild and attractive personality; and a personal grievance against Napoleon
During the national war he was inactive because he was not needed
the man who from his early years had striven only for his people’s welfare
the originator of the liberal innovations in his fatherland—now that he seemed to possess the utmost power and therefore to have the possibility of bringing about the welfare of his peoples—at the time when Napoleon in exile was drawing up childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made mankind happy had he retained power—Alexander I
having fulfilled his mission and feeling the hand of God upon him
Let me live like a man and think of my soul and of God
As the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere complete in itself
and yet at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to comprehend
And the child is afraid of bees and declares that bees exist to sting people
A botanist notices that the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil fertilizes the latter
and may say that in this lies the purpose of the bee
that the ultimate purpose is beyond our comprehension
All that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee to other manifestations of life
and the old countess’ grief fell blow after blow on the old count’s head
He seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all these events
and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting and inviting further blows which would finish him
He seemed now frightened and distraught and now unnaturally animated and enterprising
The arrangements for Natásha’s marriage occupied him for a while
He ordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful
The countess passed a fortnight in an armchair by his pillow without undressing
he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for having dissipated their property—that being the chief fault of which he was conscious
It was just when the count’s affairs had become so involved that it was impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that he unexpectedly died
and without waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went to Moscow
The state of the count’s affairs became quite obvious a month after his death
surprising everyone by the immense total of small debts the existence of which no one had suspected
The debts amounted to double the value of the property
Friends and relations advised Nicholas to decline the inheritance
As always happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should get paid first
and those who had seemed to pity the old man—the cause of their losses (if they were losses)—now remorselessly pursued the young heir who had voluntarily undertaken the debts and was obviously not guilty of contracting them
He could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel at the next vacancy
and moved with his mother and Sónya to a small house on the Sívtsev Vrazhók
Nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him
but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty
and helped Nicholas to conceal their poverty from the old countess
He felt that the more he valued her the less he loved her
and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern satisfaction in an uncomplaining endurance of his position
He tried to avoid his old acquaintances with their commiseration and offensive offers of assistance; he avoided all distraction and recreation
He seemed carefully to cherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled him to endure his position
CHAPTER VI  At the beginning of winter Princess Mary came to Moscow
From reports current in town she learned how the Rostóvs were situated
But remembering her relations with Nicholas in Vorónezh she was shy about doing so
as the countess’ room could only be reached through his
and having sat there for five minutes left the room
When the princess came out of the countess’ room Nicholas met her again
and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroom
Nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any more
but yet always became ill-humored when she began to talk about her
She is a very admirable young woman and you always liked her
trying to divert his mother’s attention to another topic
After her visit to the Rostóvs and her unexpectedly chilly reception by Nicholas
I have nothing to do with him and I only wanted to see the old lady
who was always kind to me and to whom I am under many obligations
But she could not pacify herself with these reflections; a feeling akin to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit
Though she had firmly resolved not to call on the Rostóvs again and to forget the whole matter
polite manner did not express his feeling for her (she knew that) but it concealed something
With a firm resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation
she sent for Mademoiselle Bourienne and went with her to the drawing room
Her first glance at Nicholas’ face told her that he had only come to fulfill the demands of politeness
she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her
made some remark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and then again looked at the princess
She still sat motionless with a look of suffering on her gentle face
Princess Mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones as he said this
But this is not at all an interesting or cheerful subject
His face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression
Within four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without selling any of his wife’s property
he soon grew so devoted to it that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation
and did not make a hobby of any particular part of the work on his estate
He always had before his mind’s eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it
When Nicholas first began farming and began to understand its different branches
trying to understand their aims and what they considered good and bad
before entering into the debit and credit (as he ironically called it)
he found out how many cattle the peasants had and increased the number by all possible means
He kept the peasant families together in the largest groups possible
He was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants’ hay and corn as of his own
He disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs—the  drones  as he called them—and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity
he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in the house; but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation
He never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants
He knew that his every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions
He could not have said by what standard he judged what he should or should not do
speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity
Yet he loved  our Russian peasants  and their way of life with his whole soul
and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the one way and manner of farming which produced good results
She could not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy when
after getting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in the fields or on the threshing floor
he returned from the sowing or mowing or reaping to have tea with her
She did not understand why he spoke with such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and well-to-do peasant Matthew Ermíshin
who with his family had carted corn all night; or of the fact that his (Nicholas’) sheaves were already stacked before anyone else had his harvest in
She did not understand why he stepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under his mustache and winked so joyfully
when warm steady rain began to fall on the dry and thirsty shoots of the young oats
kindhearted and always ready to anticipate her wishes
she spoke of the good work he was doing for his serfs
he would be vexed and reply:  Not in the least; it never entered my head and I wouldn’t do that for their good
That’s all poetry and old wives’ talk—all that doing good to one’s neighbor
And all Nicholas did was fruitful—probably just because he refused to allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for virtue’s sake
His means increased rapidly; serfs from neighboring estates came to beg him to buy them
CHAPTER VIII  One matter connected with his management sometimes worried Nicholas
but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form of punishment suddenly changed
Once in summer he had sent for the village elder from Boguchárovo
who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery frame
and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that morning
and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charm
Before he had solved that point he glanced again at her face filled with love and pain
he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy asking for forgiveness
when in discussions with his village elders or stewards the blood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench
Nicholas would turn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before the man who was making him angry
Among the gentry of the province Nicholas was respected but not liked
He did not concern himself with the interests of his own class
reading—a task he first imposed upon himself as a duty
he spent most of his time at home making himself one with his family and entering into all the details of his children’s relations with their mother
The harmony between him and his wife grew closer and closer and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in her
He had asked Princess Mary to be gentle and kind to his cousin
and imagined that her wealth had influenced Nicholas’ choice
She could not find fault with Sónya in any way and tried to be fond of her
but often felt ill-will toward her which she could not overcome
and sometimes I think she doesn’t feel it as you or I would
Though Countess Mary told Natásha that those words in the Gospel must be understood differently
yet looking at Sónya she agreed with Natásha’s explanation
It really seemed that Sónya did not feel her position trying
and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a sterile flower
was always ready to render the small services for which she had a gift
and chairs made by their own serf carpenters out of their own birchwood
The house was spacious and had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors
as many as a hundred visitors would gather there for a day or two
Natásha had been staying at her brother’s with her husband and children since early autumn
Pierre had gone to Petersburg on business of his own for three weeks as he said
which was his name day when the house would be full of visitors
and talk about the elections of the nobility; but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve of that day in his usual way
and when she herself was in a good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and then began to talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for his ill-humor
She again inquired whether everything was going well on the farm
but could not refrain from asking some more questions
When they left the table and went as usual to thank the old countess
Nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even Sónya and the old countess
who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree
and it was always just after they had been happiest together
they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement and hostility
emaciated face in which her eyes now looked larger than ever
Sónya was always the first excuse Countess Mary found for feeling irritated
From the room in which Nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing
every slightest tone of which was familiar to his wife
Then through the door she heard Nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring
Countess Mary moved away from the door and took the boy back to the nursery
The dark-eyed little girl boldly opened the creaking door
A thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also
and looking at the child’s round happy little face he thought of what she would be like when he was an old man
A smile lit up her face but at the same time she sighed
that there is another sort of happiness unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at that instant
CHAPTER X  Natásha had married in the early spring of 1813
or when she and Countess Mary spoke of Prince Andrew (she never mentioned him to her husband
who she imagined was jealous of Prince Andrew’s memory)
or on the rare occasions when something happened to induce her to sing
a practice she had quite abandoned since her marriage
At the rare moments when the old fire did kindle in her handsome
fully developed body she was even more attractive than in former days
The young Countess Bezúkhova was not often seen in society
and those who met her there were not pleased with her and found her neither attractive nor amiable
Not that Natásha liked solitude—she did not know whether she liked it or not
she had demands on her time which could be satisfied only by renouncing society
All who had known Natásha before her marriage wondered at the change in her as at something extraordinary
Only the old countess with her maternal instinct had realized that all Natásha’s outbursts had been due to her need of children and a husband—as she herself had once exclaimed at Otrádnoe not so much in fun as in earnest—and her mother was now surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had never understood Natásha
and she kept saying that she had always known that Natásha would make an exemplary wife and mother
should be even more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried
and should fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her husband
Natásha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery
of which her singing had been an unusually powerful part
She gave it up just because it was so powerfully seductive
or to show herself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes
She felt that the allurements instinct had formerly taught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of her husband
She felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained by the poetic feelings that had attracted him to her
and sing romantic songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn herself to attract herself
To adorn herself for others might perhaps have been agreeable—she did not know—but she had no time at all for it
or to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for these things
We know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in a subject however trivial it may be
and that there is no subject so trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if one’s entire attention is devoted to it
The subject which wholly engrossed Natásha’s attention was her family: that is
the larger did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers appear
so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet was unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary
There were then as now conversations and discussions about women’s rights
the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rights
which are like the question of how to get the greatest gratification from one’s dinner
If the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the family
the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one can digest
And she not only saw no need of any other or better husband
but as all the powers of her soul were intent on serving that husband and family
She valued the company of those to whom she could come striding disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown
and with joyful face show a yellow instead of a green stain on baby’s napkin
and from whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was much better
pretty or plain—were habitual subjects of jest to those about her
and did not dare absent himself for any length of time
except on business—in which his wife included his intellectual pursuits
at home Pierre had the right to regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose
At home Natásha placed herself in the position of a slave to her husband
Pierre had but to show a partiality for anything to get just what he liked done always
He had only to express a wish and Natásha would jump up and run to fulfill it
were all selected not merely with regard to Pierre’s expressed wishes
but to what Natásha from the thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be
And she deduced the essentials of his wishes quite correctly
and having once arrived at them clung to them tenaciously
When Pierre himself wanted to change his mind she would fight him with his own weapons
Thus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of their first child who was delicate
and even of her husband himself—who were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself
It very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife would have a dispute
but long afterwards Pierre to his surprise and delight would find in his wife’s ideas and actions the very thought against which she had argued
but divested of everything superfluous that in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing his opinion
After seven years of marriage Pierre had the joyous and firm consciousness that he was not a bad man
and he felt this because he saw himself reflected in his wife
He felt the good and bad within himself inextricably mingled and overlapping
And this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and mysterious reflection
CHAPTER XI  Two months previously when Pierre was already staying with the Rostóvs he had received a letter from Prince Theodore
asking him to come to Petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being discussed there by a society of which Pierre was one of the principal founders
She attributed immense importance to all her husband’s intellectual and abstract interests though she did not understand them
and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such matters
all rubbish—those discussions which lead to nothing and all those idiotic societies
While attending to him she bore the anxiety about her husband more easily
She was nursing her boy when the sound of Pierre’s sleigh was heard at the front door
Then all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had experienced for the last fortnight
for he could not have come sooner; he knew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a minute or two; above all he knew that he himself was bright and happy
joyous sunshine on Natásha’s face as she gazed tenderly at her husband and child
But in spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed
there were at Bald Hills several perfectly distinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole
that took place in that house was important to all these worlds
Pierre’s return was a joyful and important event and they all felt it to be so
and also because they would all receive handsome presents for the holidays
The children and their governesses were glad of Pierre’s return because no one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did
was delighted because Uncle Pierre as he called him was the object of his rapturous and passionate affection
No one had instilled into him this love for Pierre whom he saw only occasionally
recall and reconsider the meaning of everything Pierre had said
his love for Natásha (of whom the lad was also particularly fond)
derived the notion that his father had loved Natásha and when dying had left her to his friend
But the father whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not be pictured
were pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly and peacefully
The old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them
and especially that Natásha would now be herself again
In the early days of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expect him not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy
and gave him commissions for others only when he himself had offered to undertake them
From the time that Pierre began life as a family man on a footing entailing heavy expenditure
he had noticed to his surprise that he spent only half as much as before
and that his affairs—which had been in disorder of late
chiefly because of his first wife’s debts—had begun to improve
who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on her lap
After the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession
A peculiarity one sees in very young children and very old people was particularly evident in her
She did these things not under any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do
when behind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising their functions remains unnoticed
What for people in their full vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretext
Thus in the morning—especially if she had eaten anything rich the day before—she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiest pretext Belóva’s deafness
which would seem too dry or too damp or not rubbed fine enough
After these fits of irritability her face would grow yellow
which was usually toward seven o’clock when she had had an after-dinner rest in a darkened room
the pretext would be the retelling of the same stories over and over again to the same audience
The old lady’s condition was understood by the whole household though no one ever spoke of it
and they all made every possible effort to satisfy her needs
and Countess Mary was the common understanding of her condition expressed
and the little children failed to understand this and avoided her
CHAPTER XIII  When Pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was in one of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of playing patience
—yet it was evident that she was not pleased by Pierre’s arrival at that moment when it diverted her attention from the unfinished game
a bright-blue Sèvres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with a lid
and Denísov had much to talk about that they could not discuss before the old countess—not that anything was hidden from her
but because she had dropped so far behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in her presence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and to repeat what they had already told her many times: that so-and-so was dead and so-and-so was married
which she would again be unable to remember—yet they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from habit
and Pierre answered the countess’ questions as to whether Prince Vasíli had aged and whether Countess Mary Alexéevna had sent greetings and still thought of them
All the grown-up members of the family were assembled near the round tea table at which Sónya presided beside the samovar
The children with their tutors and governesses had had tea and their voices were audible from the next room
At tea all sat in their accustomed places: Nicholas beside the stove at a small table where his tea was handed to him; Mílka
the old gray borzoi bitch (daughter of the first Mílka)
sat beside countess Mary with his general’s tunic unbuttoned; Pierre sat between his wife and the old countess
He spoke of what he knew might interest the old lady and that she could understand
but who were now for the most part scattered about the world and like herself were garnering the last ears of the harvests they had sown in earlier years
But to the old countess those contemporaries of hers seemed to be the only serious and real society
much interested in what was occurring in Petersburg
Once or twice Pierre was carried away and began to speak of these things
knowing how to translate things into his mother’s language
and she rose (everybody else got up too) and with a severe expression sailed back to her table in the sitting room
the nearer I got to the house the more anxious I grew
and went on with what he had been saying when the children had interrupted
delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a corner
starting every now and then and muttering something to himself
The conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in power
dissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointments in the service
heard with pleasure of the things done in Petersburg which seemed to him stupid
and made forcible and sharp comments on what Pierre told them
they should let that fine fellow Bonaparte loose—he’d knock all this nonsense out of them
though free from Denísov’s readiness to find fault with everything
also thought that discussion of the government was a very serious and weighty matter
and the fact that A had been appointed Minister of This and B Governor General of That
And so he thought it necessary to take an interest in these things and to question Pierre
saw that he had long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation to another channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake of which he had gone to Petersburg to consult with his new friend Prince Theodore
who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby
and lisping:  the position in Petersburg is this: the Emperor does not look into anything
You will agree that if you did not look after your estates yourself but only wanted a quiet life
Everything is strained to such a degree that it will certainly break
To encourage culture and philanthropy is all very well of course
The aim is excellent but in the present circumstances something else is needed
When you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any moment
when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe
as many as possible must join hands as closely as they can to withstand the general calamity
but it is a society of true conservatives—a society of gentlemen in the full meaning of that word
It is only to prevent some Pugachëv or other from killing my children and yours
and Arakchéev from sending me off to some Military Settlement
Did the Tugendbund which saved Europe  (they did not then venture to suggest that Russia had saved Europe)  do any harm
It was not what he was saying that pleased her—that did not even interest her
for it seemed to her that was all extremely simple and that she had known it a long time (it seemed so to her because she knew that it sprang from Pierre’s whole soul)
but it was his animated and enthusiastic appearance that made her glad
and with a nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing wax and quill pens his hands came upon on his uncle’s table
The Tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage eaters
You say that everything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming: I don’t see it
but if you formed a secret society and began working against the government—be it what it may—I know it is my duty to obey the government
and powerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in this boy during that conversation
CHAPTER XV  The conversation at supper was not about politics or societies
but turned on the subject Nicholas liked best—recollections of 1812
She was afraid that what she was writing would not be understood or approved by her husband
She had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him
and sobbed so that I could not calm him for a long time
It was plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me
In the diary was set down everything in the children’s lives that seemed noteworthy to their mother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections on educational methods
They were for the most part quite insignificant trifles
but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either
now that he read this diary about his children for the first time
but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they were eating
The radiant eyes gazed at him questioningly: would he approve or disapprove of her diary
continual spiritual effort of which the sole aim was the children’s moral welfare delighted him
recognized his own insignificance beside her in the spiritual world
growing hot at the mere recollection of their discussion
yielding to that irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest and dearest to us
I don’t think you need reproach yourself on his account
This evening he listened to Pierre in a sort of trance
What business was it of mine when I married and was so deep in debt that I was threatened with prison
and had a mother who could not see or understand it
And then there are you and the children and our affairs
and not to leave the children such beggars as I was
Countess Mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone and that he attached too much importance to these matters
He took this as a sign of approval and a confirmation of his thoughts
today Elias Mitrofánych  (this was his overseer)  came back from the Tambóv estate and told me they are already offering eighty thousand rubles for the forest
And with an eager face Nicholas began to speak of the possibility of repurchasing Otrádnoe before long
Countess Mary listened to her husband and understood all that he told her
She knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimes ask her what he had been saying
She felt a submissive tender love for this man who would never understand all that she understood
and this seemed to make her love for him still stronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness
Besides this feeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following the details of her husband’s plans
but compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him
and felt with regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young Nicholas
Sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the difference in their ages
From the moment they were alone and Natásha came up to him with wide-open happy eyes
contrary to all the laws of logic and contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about at one and the same time
so in this intercourse contrary to all laws of reason
the words themselves were not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted them
Natásha spoke to Pierre about her brother’s life and doings
In saying this Natásha was sincere in acknowledging Mary’s superiority
Natásha knew why he mentioned Mítya’s likeness to Nicholas: the recollection of his dispute with his brother-in-law was unpleasant and he wanted to know what Natásha thought of it
Nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally accepted
when I was in Petersburg I felt (I can say this to you) that the whole affair would go to pieces without me—everyone was pulling his own way
and passed in review all those whom Pierre most respected
It was the sequel to his complacent reflections on his success in Petersburg
At that moment it seemed to him that he was chosen to give a new direction to the whole of Russian society and to the whole world
I only wished to say that ideas that have great results are always simple ones
Meanwhile downstairs in young Nicholas Bolkónski’s bedroom a little lamp was burning as usual
(The boy was afraid of the dark and they could not cure him of it
which was similar to those threads but rather thicker
Suddenly the threads that moved them began to slacken and become entangled and it grew difficult to move
but I have orders from Arakchéev and will kill the first of you who moves forward
Little Nicholas turned to look at Pierre but Pierre was no longer there
The ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describe and seize the apparently elusive—the life of a people
They described the activity of individuals who ruled the people
and regarded the activity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nation
The question: how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by what was the will of these individuals themselves guided
the ancients met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of a chosen man
and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish ends that were predestined
It would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in man’s subjection to the Deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations are led
Instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by the will of God
which ancient historians regarded as representing the progress of humanity
the welfare and civilization of humanity in general
by which is usually meant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a large continent
Modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without replacing them by a new conception
and the logic of the situation has obliged the historians
and (2) the existence of a known aim to which these nations and humanity at large are tending
At the basis of the works of all the modern historians from Gibbon to Buckle
and is expressed by a movement of peoples from west to east
The counter movement reaches the starting point of the first movement in the west—Paris—and subsides
and most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the monuments and tradition of that period
For a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the science of history
whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know themselves
One might believe or disbelieve in the divine significance of Napoleon
Then listen:   Louis XIV was a very proud and self-confident man; he had such and such mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled France badly
His descendants were weak men and they too ruled France badly
At the end of the eighteenth century there were a couple of dozen men in Paris who began to talk about all men being free and equal
but in 1811 they again quarreled and again began killing many people
united Europe to arm against the disturber of its peace
not depriving him of the title of Emperor and showing him every respect
Then the skillful statesmen and diplomatists (especially Talleyrand
who managed to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and thereby extended the frontiers of France) talked in Vienna and by these conversations made the nations happy or unhappy
Suddenly the diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of again ordering their armies to kill one another
separated from the beloved France so dear to his heart
died a lingering death on that rock and bequeathed his great deeds to posterity
But in Europe a reaction occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress their subjects
It would be a mistake to think that this is ironic—a caricature of the historical accounts
from the compilers of memoirs and the histories of separate states to the writers of general histories and the new histories of the culture of that period
If the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of humanity and of the peoples
we ought to be shown the connection existing between these men and the movement of the nations
If instead of a divine power some other force has appeared
it should be explained in what this new force consists
for the whole interest of history lies precisely in that force
anyone reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new force
Biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers
The answers given by this kind of historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event
for this force is understood by them all not only differently but often in quite contradictory ways
destroy the understanding of the force which produces events
and furnish no reply to history’s essential question
Writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians’ view of the force which produces events
They do not recognize it as a power inherent in heroes and rulers
a general historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power of one man
but in the interaction of many persons connected with the event
and at another plainly say that the campaign of 1812 and other things they do not like were simply the product of Napoleon’s misdirected will
and that the very ideas of 1789 were arrested in their development by Napoleon’s caprice
The ideas of the Revolution and the general temper of the age produced Napoleon’s power
but the universal historians’ accounts are all made up of a chain of such contradictions
This contradiction occurs because after entering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfway
This condition is never observed by the universal historians
another unexplained force affecting the resultant action
and others spoke certain words to one another only affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission of millions
And therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs the submission of millions of people resulted—that is
A third class of historians—the so-called historians of culture—following the path laid down by the universal historians who sometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing events—again take that force to be something quite different
They see it in what is called culture—in mental activity
for if historical events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one another in such and such ways
why not explain them by the fact that such and such people wrote such and such books
Of the immense number of indications accompanying every vital phenomenon
these historians select the indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is the cause
But despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events lies in intellectual activity
only by a great stretch can one admit that there is any connection between intellectual activity and the movement of peoples
and in no case can one admit that intellectual activity controls people’s actions
for that view is not confirmed by such facts as the very cruel murders of the French Revolution resulting from the doctrine of the equality of man
or the very cruel wars and executions resulting from the preaching of love
But even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with which these histories are filled—admitting that nations are governed by some undefined force called an idea—history’s essential question still remains unanswered
the connection of which with the masses needs explanation
had the effect of making Frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without an explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event
Undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously
and so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual activity of men and their historical movements
But why intellectual activity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause or expression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand
Only the following considerations can have led the historians to such a conclusion: (1) that history is written by learned men
and so it is natural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class supplies the basis of the movement of all humanity
indefinite conceptions under whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still less definite meaning
and which can therefore be readily introduced into any theory
But not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind (which may possibly even be of use to someone for something) the histories of culture
to which all general histories tend more and more to approximate
as soon as they have to describe an actual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 for instance
the historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves
and show that the new force they have devised does not account for what happens in history
Another man says the locomotive moves because its wheels go round
To refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil
But the man who says that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself
for having once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why the wheels go round; and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the movement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler
he has no right to stop in his search for the cause
The man who explains the movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back has noticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken the first sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as an explanation
The only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is that of a force commensurate with the movement observed
The only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peoples
Yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of different kinds
as the peasant sees the devil in the locomotive; others as a force resulting from several other forces
it is quite impossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception of a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain end
And the only such conception known to historians is that of power
without finding some other method of treating historical material
merely deprives himself of the one possible way of dealing with it
The necessity of the conception of power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by the universal historians and historians of culture themselves
the science of history up to now is like money in circulation—paper money and coin
The biographies and special national histories are like paper money
They can be used and can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even advantageously
as long as no one asks what is the security behind them
You need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events
and such histories as Thiers’ will be interesting and instructive and may perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry
too much of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold
wants to exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual comprehension
but nobody is deceived by tokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle
As gold is gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use
so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to history’s essential question: what is power
The universal historians give contradictory replies to that question
while the historians of culture evade it and answer something quite different
only in universities and among the mass of readers who have a taste for what they call  serious reading
CHAPTER IV  Having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjection of that man’s will to the Deity
the belief has been destroyed; and so it is essential to explain what is meant by power
Napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war
it becomes essential to determine what is this power of one man over others
It cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak one—a domination based on the application or threat of physical force
like the power of Hercules; nor can it be based on the effect of moral force
men gifted with a special strength of soul and mind called genius
not to mention heroes such as Napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely
but on the contrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they ruled over
If the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral qualities of him who possesses it
it must evidently be looked for elsewhere—in the relation to the people of the man who wields the power
And that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence
that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange history’s understanding of power for true gold
which consists of discussions of how a state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to be arranged
it is all very clear; but when applied to history that definition of power needs explanation
just as for modern physics fire is not an element but a phenomenon
From this fundamental difference between the view held by history and that held by jurisprudence
it follows that jurisprudence can tell minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what power—existing immutably outside time—is
but to history’s questions about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer nothing
If power be the collective will of the people transferred to their ruler
is the will of the people also transferred to their conqueror
Was the will of the Confederation of the Rhine transferred to Napoleon in 1806
Was the will of the Russian people transferred to Napoleon in 1809
when our army in alliance with the French went to fight the Austrians
result solely from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown conditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some people to others
And these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the relation of the people to their rulers
Some historians—those biographical and specialist historians already referred to—in their simplicity failing to understand the question of the meaning of power
seem to consider that the collective will of the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons
and therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular power to be the one absolute and real power
suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history
and Bonaparte were mere infringers of the true power
another set of historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will of the people to their rulers
and that historical leaders have power only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them
But what this program consists in these historians do not say
or enlightenment of citizens of France or some other country
But not to mention the historians’ contradictions as to the nature of this program—or even admitting that some one general program of these conditions exists—the facts of history almost always contradict that theory
how is it that Louis XIV and Iván the Terrible end their reigns tranquilly
while Louis XVI and Charles I are executed by their people
Equally little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs
and conquests—are presented by these historians not as the results of free transferences of the people’s will
having noticed that some plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons
express the will of the people: the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people
But in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the leaders serves as an expression of the people’s will or only some part of it
then all the details of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a Napoleon or a Catherine serve to express the life of the nation
which is evident nonsense; but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an historical leader which serves to express the people’s life
as other so-called  philosophical  historians believe
then to determine which side of the activity of a leader expresses the nation’s life
we have first of all to know in what the nation’s life consists
and general abstraction which can cover all conceivable occurrences
and declare this abstraction to be the aim of humanity’s movement
Postulating some generalization as the goal of the movement of humanity
to the extent to which in their opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction
and as the connection of the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based on the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is always transferred to the men whom we have noticed
Is the movement of the Russian people eastward to Kazán and Siberia expressed by details of the morbid character of Iván the Terrible and by his correspondence with Kúrbski
Is the movement of the peoples at the time of the Crusades explained by the life and activity of the Godfreys and the Louis-es and their ladies
and knights incited the peoples to free the Holy Land; but the people did not go
for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to go no longer existed
The history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the peoples
And the history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers has remained the history of Godfreys and Minnesingers
but the history of the life of the peoples and their impulses has remained unknown
Still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the life of the peoples
The history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of life and thought of a writer or a reformer
We learn that Luther had a hot temper and said such and such things; we learn that Rousseau was suspicious and wrote such and such books; but we do not learn why after the Reformation the peoples massacred one another
CHAPTER V  The life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men
for the connection between those men and the nations has not been found
The theory that this connection is based on the transference of the collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history
as soon as history begins—that theory explains nothing
Whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs
the theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because the collective will was transferred to him
The replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the replies of a man who
should attribute the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head
The herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that leader
this happens because the collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to another
according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in the direction selected by the whole herd
Such is the reply historians who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to rulers under conditions which they regard as known
If the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of the whole herd is constantly altered
this is because in order to follow a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that have attracted our attention
and to study the movements of the herd we must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all sides of the herd
Power is the collective will of the people transferred to one person
Under what condition is the will of the people delegated to one person
power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand
If the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning
then having subjected to criticism the explanation of  power  that juridical science gives us
And experience tells us that power is not merely a word but an actually existing phenomenon
Not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity of men can do without the conception of power
the existence of power is proved both by history and by observing contemporary events
Napoleon III issues a decree and the French go to Mexico
The King of Prussia and Bismarck issue decrees and an army enters Bohemia
Napoleon I issues a decree and an army enters Russia
Alexander I gives a command and the French submit to the Bourbons
in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine intervention in human affairs
want to see the cause of events in the expression of the will of someone endowed with power
but that supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience
even if we admitted that words could be the cause of events
and sometimes the very opposite of what they order occurs
is merely the relation that exists between the expression of someone’s will and the execution of that will by others
But speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting in time and in relation to one another
to explain the connection of commands with events we must restore: (1) the condition of all that takes place: the continuity of movement in time both of the events and of the person who commands
and (2) the inevitability of the connection between the person commanding and those who execute his command
or itself covers a whole series of occurrences; but each command follows from another
we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive commands dependent one on another
Napoleon could not have commanded an invasion of Russia and never did so
which formed a whole series corresponding to a series of events which brought the French armies into Russia
If throughout his reign Napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion of England and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort
and yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that design but undertook an expedition into Russia
it is necessary that a man should order what can be executed
But to know what can and what cannot be executed is impossible
for in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its execution
Every order executed is always one of an immense number unexecuted
All the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of events remain unexecuted
Our false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of thousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that event have been executed
such for instance as all those which led the French armies to Russia
is generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that series of events
and corresponding with this generalization the whole series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will
We say that Napoleon wished to invade Russia and invaded it
was carried out—not because those orders differed in any way from the other
unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of events that led the French army into Russia; just as in stencil work this or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on from this side or in that way
but because it was laid on from all sides over the figure cut in the stencil
So that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events
we find that a command can never be the cause of the event
but that a certain definite dependence exists between the two
that the man who gives the command himself takes part in the event
This relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is called power
This relation consists in the following:  For common action people always unite in certain combinations
in which regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action
the relation between those taking part in it is always the same
in the collective action for which they have combined
Of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of the most striking and definite examples is an army
Every army is composed of lower grades of the service—the rank and file—of whom there are always the greatest number; of the next higher military rank—corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer
and of still-higher officers of whom there are still fewer
and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one person
A military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone
and always receives orders for these actions from men above him; he himself never gives an order
The commander in chief never takes direct part in the action itself
but only gives general orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops
And so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of a cone and of the ranks of an army
combine in such relations that the more directly they participate in performing the action the less they can command and the more numerous they are
while the less their direct participation in the action itself
the more they command and the fewer of them there are; rising in this way from the lowest ranks to the man at the top
who takes the least direct share in the action and directs his activity chiefly to commanding
This relation of the men who command to those they command is what constitutes the essence of the conception called power
Having restored the condition of time under which all events occur
we find that a command is executed only when it is related to a corresponding series of events
Restoring the essential condition of relation between those who command and those who execute
we find that by the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest part in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed to commanding
CHAPTER VII  When an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes about it
and as the event results from the collective activity of many people
There we have command and power in their primary form
The man who worked most with his hands could not think so much about what he was doing
or reflect on or command what would result from the common activity; while the man who commanded more would evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater verbal activity
When some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aim there is a yet sharper division of those who
For reasons known or unknown to us the French began to drown and kill one another
Men went from the west to the east killing their fellow men
History shows us that these justifications of the events have no common sense and are all contradictory
as in the case of killing a man as the result of recognizing his rights
and the killing of millions in Russia for the humiliation of England
But these justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day
These justifications release those who produce the events from moral responsibility
These temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front: they clear men’s moral responsibilities from their path
Without such justification there would be no reply to the simplest question that presents itself when examining each historical event
the flow of the waves it cuts will always be noticeable ahead of it
To those on board the ship the movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion
Only by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow and comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves that every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship
and that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were imperceptibly moving
We see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical characters (that is
re-establish the inevitable condition of all that occurs—the continuity of movement in time) and do not lose sight of the essential connection of historical persons with the masses
When the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave ahead of it
when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns frequently
But wherever it may turn there always will be the wave anticipating its movement
the rush of water which neither directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it
and at a distance seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the ship’s movement also
historians have assumed that the events depended on those commands
But examining the events themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to the people
the event does not take place unless there are other causes for it
but as soon as an event occurs—be it what it may—then out of all the continually expressed wishes of different people some will always be found which by their meaning and their time of utterance are related as commands to the events
Arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to these two essential questions of history:  (1) What is power
(2) What force produces the movement of the nations
nor even by a combination of the two as historians have supposed
but by the activity of all the people who participate in the events
and who always combine in such a way that those taking the largest direct share in the event take on themselves the least responsibility and vice versa
Morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event; physically it is those who submit to the power
But as the moral activity is inconceivable without the physical
the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the phenomena we are examining
Atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another
We only know that to produce the one or the other action
people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part
CHAPTER VIII  If history dealt only with external phenomena
All seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this question
all history would be a series of disconnected incidents
it is evident that one single free act of that man’s in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity
In this contradiction lies the problem of free will
which from most ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance
or philosophic—we find a general law of necessity to which he (like all that exists) is subject
but only through consciousness does he know himself
man must first of all be conscious of himself as living
Everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable demonstration of freedom
That reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to reason
If the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent source of self-consciousness it would be subject to reasoning and to experience
but in fact such subjection does not exist and is inconceivable
and man submits to them and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he has become acquainted with them
But the same series of experiments and arguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is conscious in himself is impossible
and the motives acting upon him; yet man never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments
Having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls downwards
a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law that he has learned to be fulfilled
However often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as before
yet when under the same conditions and with the same character he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the same way
however incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the same conditions
A man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of life
recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone without exception
Man’s actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting upon him
Man in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject to laws which determine that life
But the same man apart from that connection appears to be free
Only in our self-confident day of the popularization of knowledge—thanks to that most powerful engine of ignorance
the diffusion of printed matter—has the question of the freedom of will been put on a level on which the question itself cannot exist
In our time the majority of so-called advanced people—that is
the crowd of ignoramuses—have taken the work of the naturalists who deal with one side of the question for a solution of the whole problem
They say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist
reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain
and that man following the general law may have developed from lower animals at some unknown period of time
If men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time
that is as comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at a certain period of time (in the first case the unknown quantity is the time
are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls of a church who
availing themselves of the absence of the chief superintendent of the work
CHAPTER IX  For the solution of the question of free will or inevitability
history has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the question is dealt with
history stands to the other sciences as experimental science stands to abstract science
is very clearly and definitely understood without any sense of contradiction
although each event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsory
To solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and what constitutes the essence of these two conceptions
the philosophy of history can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by other sciences
Instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom and inevitability in themselves
and then ranging the phenomena of life under those definitions
history should deduce a definition of the conception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear dependent on these two elements
Whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual we may consider
we always regard it as the result partly of man’s free will and partly of the law of inevitability
The degree of freedom and inevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined for us
Our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to differences in the point of view from which we regard the event
but every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and inevitability
In every action we examine we see a certain measure of freedom and a certain measure of inevitability
The proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases according to the point of view from which the action is regarded
but their relation is always one of inverse proportion
A sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him; or a hungry mother exhausted by feeding her baby
to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were placed
Similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago and has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guilty and his action more due to the law of inevitability
or highly excited man appears less free and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him who committed the action
and seems more free and less inevitable to one who does not know it
In all these cases the conception of freedom is increased or diminished and the conception of compulsion is correspondingly decreased or increased
according to the point of view from which the action is regarded
and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and freedom
(3) His relation to the causes leading to the action
The first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the man’s relation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness of our understanding of the definite position occupied by the man in relation to everything coexisting with him
This is what makes it evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity than one standing on dry ground
even with the air he breathes or the light that falls on the things about him—we see that each of these circumstances has an influence on him and controls at least some side of his activity
And the more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of his freedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity that weighs on him increases
The second consideration is the more or less evident time relation of the man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place the man’s action occupies in time
appear evidently less free than a man’s entry into marriage today
The degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performance of the action and our judgment of it
or what is the same thing the farther I go forward in my judgment
the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my action
In history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity
A contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the known participants
but with a more remote event we already see its inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible
And the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do they appear
But in the Crusades we already see an event occupying its definite place in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history of Europe
though to the chroniclers of the Crusades that event appeared as merely due to the will of certain people
In regard to the migration of the peoples it does not enter anyone’s head today to suppose that the renovation of the European world depended on Attila’s caprice
The farther back in history the object of our observation lies
the more doubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become and the more manifest the law of inevitability
must have its definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause of what will follow
and historical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlled
and the simpler the action we are observing and the less complex the character and mind of the man in question
the more subject to inevitability and the less free do our actions and those of others appear
In the case of a crime we most urgently demand the punishment for such an act; in the case of a virtuous act we rate its merit most highly
But if even one of the innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain element of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crime
is more comprehensible than gratuitous self-sacrifice
if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the correlation of cause and effect in people’s actions
their actions appear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly we connect the effects with the causes
If we examined simple actions and had a vast number of such actions under observation
our conception of their inevitability would be still greater
The dishonest conduct of the son of a dishonest father
and so on are actions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause
knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and intelligence in question
we see so large an element of necessity and so little free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action we can foretell the result
On these three considerations alone is based the conception of irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted by all legislative codes
The responsibility appears greater or less according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in which the man was placed whose action is being judged
and according to the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of the action and its investigation
and according to the greater or lesser understanding of the causes that led to the action
and the greater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which we contemplate a man’s life
So that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the external world is well known
where the time between the action and its examination is great
and where the causes of the action are most accessible
we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a minimum of free will
we get the conception of a minimum of inevitability and a maximum of freedom
In neither case—however we may change our point of view
however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes of the action may be—can we ever conceive either complete freedom or complete necessity
My action seems to me free; but asking myself whether I could raise my arm in every direction
I see that I raised it in the direction in which there was least obstruction to that action either from things around me or from the construction of my own body
I chose one out of all the possible directions because in it there were fewest obstacles
For my action to be free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles
For if I examine an action committed a second ago I must still recognize it as not being free
but ask myself: could I have abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed
To convince myself of this I do not lift it the next moment
the arm I then lifted is no longer the same as the arm I now refrain from lifting
nor is the air in which I lifted it the same that now surrounds me
That I did not lift my arm a moment later does not prove that I could have abstained from lifting it then
I raise my arm to perform an action independently of any cause
but my wish to perform an action without a cause is the cause of my action
unevoked by any cause—we were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled zero
In the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid of freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability
for the number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space
And therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined
there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom remains
and so in this respect too there can never be absolute inevitability
(3) However accessible may be the chain of causation of any action
admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to equal zero
by so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are examining
for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man
And so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as the conception of a man’s completely free action
And so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of inevitability without any freedom
(2) Time is infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise
for I feel myself to be the cause of every manifestation of my life
Reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability
Consciousness gives expression to the essence of freedom
do we get the mutually exclusive and separately incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability
Only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of man’s life
incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is conscious
is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject (from the fact that every man dies
up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws)
All knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the laws of reason
Man’s free will differs from every other force in that man is directly conscious of it
or chemical affinity are only distinguished from one another in that they are differently defined by reason
it is only a momentary undefinable sensation of life
And as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies
just in the same way does the force of free will form the content of history
But just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the subject of metaphysics
and in dependence on cause forms the subject of history

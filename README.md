# Chatbots are everywhere.  

The purpose of this project is to explore RNNs and build a chatbot which could be utilized in a general customer service environment
The difficulty of the project stems from the vagueness of the problem
The chatbot must be able to handle conversation, and return values which are human readable.



# Data Collection
Twitter was used for the final chatbot
A twitter scraper was coded to do so
Overnight scraping resulted in 500k records
I decided to make the chatbot more “literary”, by adding sentences from war and peace to the final product

# Data Inspection
Tensor Board was used for data exploration.  

# Feature Selection

Words and sentences the features of the project. \
Vocabulary of 8000 words was used 

# Tools
Python was used for coding.  \
Tensorflow was used.  \
Tensor Board was used for analysis\
Recurrent Neural Networks were used\
Anaconda  

# Libraries
NUMPY\
Tensorflow (0.1.2)

# Machine Learning Methods
Deep learning was used \
RNN and LSTM were used.  

# Problem Solving 
Overall, the project was challenging
Finding a way to make a chatbot work was difficult.  Initial training attempts resulted in chatbots which did not provide useful returns
Setting up environment, code, and experimentation proved time consuming.   

# Code
There are 2 parts of the code, the twitter scraper, which results in a corpus, and later a cleaned corpus, and a chatbot, which finalizes the data, trains, and tests the chatbot.
